abstract = {The invasion of Britain by American mink has had a catastrophic impact on water vote populations. We surveyed and live-trapped water votes over 2 years in eight c. 25 km(2) blocks in the upland of Scotland behind and ahead of the mink invasion front. Water votes had a similar distribution in the Grampian Mountains of north-east Scotland, on the edge of the invasion front, and in the Assynt area of north-west Sutherland well beyond the front. Water votes occurred in small, discrete colonies. Median nearest-neighbour distance between colonies was 0.6-0.7 kin in both areas. Colonies experienced a high degree of turnover with extinction and colonization being commonplace and only a fraction of suitable sites were occupied at a given time. High dispersal rates connecting numerous (> 30) colonies over large areas (> 25 km(2)) enable water votes to persist in such circumstances. Synchronized fluctuations in occupancy not caused by mink also occurred at the regional scales of the Grampian Mountains and Assynt areas. Localized mink invasions have fragmented a previously continuous metapopulation into smaller clusters and this may indirectly affect the likely persistence of water vote colonies not directly exposed to predation by mink.},

abstract = {Japanese sika deer (Cervus nippon nippon) were introduced to Scotland around 80 years (20 generations) ago. The sika phenotype is expanding its range and hybridizing extensively with native red deer (Cervus elaphus) leading to the establishment of a hybrid zone. This zone is currently moving and cannot be considered to be at equilibrium. Cervid genotypes and mitochondrial haplotypes were mapped across the sika phenotype range, using diagnostic protein isozymes, microsatellite nuclear DNA markers and RFLPs in mtDNA. These were analysed to estimate heterozygote deficits and nuclear linkage disequilibria and cytonuclear disequilibria in relation to gene frequencies and time since contact. Introgression was found in both taxa and strong linkage disequilibria and heterozygote deficits characterize the populations longest exposed to hybridization. Populations further from the introduction site, where hybridization is facilitated by the dispersal of sika-like stags, show low values for linkage disequilibria and heterozygote deficit. The observed patterns in genotype are explained in terms of assortative mating and a selective advantage of the sika genotype. The genetic integrity of the Scottish mainland red deer is shown to be at risk from the invasion of sika.},

abstract = {Whereas in most leporid species studied the effects of exposure to Myxoma virus (MV) are benign, in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) it causes an epizootic disease with particularly high mortality rates, known as myxomatosis. Chemokine receptors are known to play an important role in infection by large DNA viruses such as MV, by acting as portals for viral entry into the host cell. As with the human immunodeficiency virus, CCR5 is among the major candidates to affect resistance to myxomatosis. Previous sequence comparisons of the CCR5 gene among Leporid species revealed that a drastic change occurred at the second extracellular loop which was unique to the European rabbit species. Here we report that European rabbit shares this particular alteration with two of its closest relatives: the South African Riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) and the Japanese Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi). Both species represent monotypic genera and are included in the IUCN Red List as Endangered. It would then be urgent to study the susceptibility of these species to myxomatosis. Despite the lack of direct evidence that the altered CCR5 can affect the outcome of exposure to MV, the reported findings justify preventive measures to be considered.},

Five species of helminths were recovered but only one of these (Capillaria murissylvatici) was site-specific (Dungeness). Total species richness was therefore 5 at Dungeness and 4 at the other two sites. Mean species richness was 1.4, but in adult mice there was a pronounced difference between the sites, and an independent highly significant effect of season. Syphacia stroma and Corrigia vitta both showed marked differences between sites in respect: of prevalence and abundance of infection. Capillaria murissylvatici was encountered at Dungeness mostly in the spring whereas seasonal changes in abundance of S. stroma were consistent across all three sites. Seasonal fluctuations in the abundance of Catenotaenia pusilla were compounded by differences between sites. Host sex was not a significant factor in any species, although a posteriori analysis of S. stroma worm burdens for the Isle of Wight site revealed a moderate local sex effect. Overall the principal determinants of variation in helminth burdens were the extrinsic factors, site and season.},

abstract = {Aim Using six free-living deer species in Great Britain as a case study, we studied biogeographical relationships of ecologically related species composed of both native and introduced species. Location Great Britain. Methods We modelled the environmental favourability for the deer species using variables related with spatial location, climate, topography, human disturbances and habitat structure. Favourability values of each pair of native (naturalized)-introduced species were used to estimate the fuzzy overlap index (FOvI) as a measure of overall similarity between the environmental requirements for the species in Great Britain. The absolute local overlap values (FOvI-L) were also used to measure the degree to which a given location was favourable simultaneously for each pair of species. We assessed the trends of species favourability across a range defined by the absolute local overlap values and studied the shape of the obtained curves since they informs us about the favourability balance between the studied species. Results Muntjac and Chinese water deer attained higher favourability values than native species in localities with intermediate values of FOvI-L (a reduced number in the study area), suggesting that if competitive relationships were established in these localities the introduced deer species may have some advantages over natives. Sika deer only achieved higher values than fallow deer in those localities clearly unfavourable for the naturalized species. Our analyses predicted that fallow deer will be less affected by the introduced deer species than native species. Main conclusions We developed an approach based on the favourability function to describe biogeographical relationships between species, natives and introduced and to assess from a biogeographical perspective if introduced species could pose a competitive risk to natives. Although the results of present analyses do not conclusively demonstrate competitive exclusion, they provide directional hypotheses that can be tested in experimental field and laboratory studies.},

abstract = {The Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust's National Gamebag Census (NGC) has been collecting voluntary bag returns from shoots across the UK since 1961. Methods similar to the ones used for bird census data are applied to NGC data to derive annual bag indices for the UK, assess temporal trends and evaluate changes in bags over 50, 25 and 12 years for 30 bird species and 15 mammal species, as well as for numbers released of four bird species. Total UK bags and numbers released in the 2004 and 2012 seasons are obtained by splitting up aggregate bags from two independent surveys (PACEC 2006, 2014) in relation to their NGC species composition. These are used to calibrate NGC species-specific bag indices and obtain estimates of total UK bags and numbers released for the 2016 season. Over 50years, large changes have taken place in the bags and numbers released of some species whereas bags of others have remained approximately constant. This work contributes to pan-European efforts seeking a rational assessment of hunting effects within a policy combining conservation and the sustainable use of wildlife, in line with national and international legislation.},

Here we test the hypothesis that this difference is due to the fact that woodland provides substantially more food than do sand-dunes. Our experimental approach was to provide supplementary food (wheat grain) to a sand-dune population for a period of 22 months and to compare demographic responses with a control population. The supplemented population increased rapidly and reached a size 6-7 times that of the control population. The overall annual pattern of changes in density were similar in both populations with minimum numbers in late spring, maximum numbers in autumn and a loss of individuals over the winter. The woodmice receiving supplementary food bred earlier and for longer than did the control mice.},

abstract = {1. We use structured demographic accounting to decompose the contribution to the variance in relative population growth between 1971 and 1997 in female red deer on Rum, Scotland, in terms of different fitness components and age categories. 2. During the first 10 years (1971-80) the variance in relative population growth was small (0.00246) as the population grew from 58 to 148 having been culled previously. After this the relative variance in population growth increased to 0.00575 between 1981 and 1989, and increased again to 0.00848 between 1990 and 1997. 3. in the first phase of population growth (1971-80) changes in the birth rate contributed most to the variance in relative population growth (30%), then adult winter survival (23%), with calf summer and calf winter survival contributing less than 10%. Birth rate tended to covary strongly with adult winter survival, and to a lesser extent with calf winter survival. 4. The contribution of birth rate to the variance in relative population growth diminished to less than 5% in both the periods 1981-89 and 1990-97. In contrast, the contribution of adult winter survival increased to 36% in 1980s and 40% in 1990s. At the same time, the covariation of adult winter survival with calf winter survival increased successively to reach 40% in 1990-97. 5. Changes in population age structure were small and contributed little to the variance in relative population growth (approximate to 1% over the entire study). In the 1970s the 5-7-year-old group contributed most (23%) to the variance in relative population growth, though this covaried with 8-12-year-olds. In the 1980s the 8-12-year-olds contributed most (27%) and now the covariation was with older animals (>12-year-olds). This pattern persisted in the 1990s, though there was covariation with 5-7-year-olds too. 6. Birth rate, calf winter survival and adult winter survival were all density-dependent. The strength of density dependence within each vital rate did not differ between the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s; however, there were differences in the means of these vital rates relative to population size between the three periods. 7. The implications of temporal changes in the most important vital rates, the 'key factors', contributing to the variance in relative population growth rate are discussed.},

Female red deer on the Island of Rum (Scotland) aggregate in unstable matrilineal groups. The degree of spatial association ('proximity') between individuals increases with their degree of relatedness as well as with their dominance rank but declines with increasing age. 3. As population density doubled between 1974 and 1983, the degree of spatial association between female kin declined. At all ages, individuals spent less time close to their relatives and more with unrelated animals when population density was high. 4. These results emphasize that in mammals with fission/fusion societies like red deer, dispersal is a gradual process and that it does not necessarily involve the total abandonment of the natal area by individuals as they disperse.},

abstract = {Between 1992 and 1996, 95 rabbits from the immediate locality of Malham Tam, North Yorkshire, UK were examined for the presence of helminth parasites. All the examinations took place in late September or October. Three species of nematodes, Graphidium strigosum, Passalurus ambiguus and Trichostrongylus retortaeformis and two species of cestodes, Taenia pisiformis and Cittotaenia pectinata were identified. There were no associations between helminth species richness and year of sampling, host weight or sex. A logistic model was fitted to the prevalence data from these helminths as was an over-dispersed Poisson model to the worm burden data. Graphidium strigosum was the most frequently identified species with an average prevalence of 78%. The mean prevalence and intensity of Graphidium infection were significantly effected by sampling year. The lower than normal rainfall recorded at the Tarn during the years 1995 and 1996 may have be one reason for this pattern. The worm burden of G. strigosum was significantly positively associated with rabbit body weight. The intensity of infection with P. ambiguus was significantly higher in female rabbits. There was a significant non-linear relationship between I? ambiguus worm burden and rabbit weight (P=0.002) with worm burdens being highest in the 1000 g to 1499 g weight cohort. Trichostrongylus retortaeformis was only identified in 1994 and male rabbits harboured significantly higher worm burdens than females (48 vs. 7, P = 0.022). Over the five years, the average Taenia pisiformis prevalence was 31% and there was a significant positive association between worm burden and rabbit weight (P=0.001). Cittotaenia pectinata had a prevalence of 37% over the whole study period with no interactions between prevalence or intensity and body weight, year of sampling or rabbit sex.

abstract = {Diet is an essential element for understanding how the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) is re-colonizing its former range in England following a population decline observed in the 1950s to 1970s. Otter spraints from the River Glaven catchment (north Norfolk, eastern England) were collected seasonally between 2009 and 2010 from three habitat types (ponds, retenus (small in-stream reservoirs), and stream stretches). Feeding tactics of the otter were compared between habitat types and, using previously published data, with regard to seasonal changes since the 1970s when the species was in decline. Otter diet composition varied greatly, with predation on aquatic invertebrates, crayfish, fish, and tetrapods. Fruit seeds were also found in the spraints. Diet generally reflected habitat, with northern pike (Esox lucius) remains found in spraints from ponds and retenus, whereas European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and gudgeon (Gobio gobio) were prominent in spraints from stream sections. Trophic diversity was particularly high in spraints collected next to ponds. Between the 1970s and the present, crayfish, brown trout (Salmo trutta), cyprinids, Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis), birds and mammals increased in prominence, whereas eel and threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) decreased, with notable seasonal variations between the study periods. Otter spraints revealed few prey preferences, with only that for gudgeon being ecologically relevant. The consumption of popular sport fishes, in particular common carp (Cyprinus carpio), has given rise to conflicts between recreational anglers and otter conservationists, but no demonstrated preference for carp was observed in the present study. Overall, otters have increased their consumption of less preferred (i.e. lower energetic value) food types, and because the species normally preys on the most abundant species available, this suggests declines in preferred prey types. These dietary shifts could contribute to otter dispersal and re-colonization of parts of its original European range where food availability may be higher. (C) 2012 Crown copyright.},

abstract = {Research in freshwater ecology has traditionally focused on water courses or large still waters. However, ponds support proportionately high levels of biodiversity relative to other inland waters in Europe, and foraging by Eurasian otter Lutra lutra (L., 1758) could have considerable impacts on species composition in these small water bodies. The aim of the present study was to analyse otter spraints around ponds during two contrasting seasons (winter and spring) in north Norfolk (eastern England), where both otter and ponds are of particular conservation concern. Spraint density, prey diversity and the consumption of river-associated species were higher in spring than winter. In both seasons, birds were the most important prey category as ingested biomass. European eel Anguilla anguilla (L., 1758) and amphibians, specifically common frog Rana temporaria L., 1758 and common toad Bufo bufo (L., 1758), were more consumed in spring, whereas northern pike Esox lucius L., 1758 and tench Tinca tinca (L., 1758) were taken in winter. Non-native common carp Cyprinus carpio L., 1758 was important in both seasons, whereas threatened native crucian carp Carassius carassius (L., 1758) was a minor prey item. Massive kills of common toad, which involved a new handling technique for predation on this species, were observed mainly in spring. The study demonstrated otters to display great plasticity in foraging behaviour and contributes to the understanding of otter predatory pressure on pond biodiversity, with implications for landscape management.},

We manipulated the early social environment of captive Kuhl's pipistrelles (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and Savi's bats (Hypsugo savii), raising newborns in artificial mixed-species groups to simulate conditions in natural mixed-species nurseries. We then measured association patterns among all bats and analyzed the occurrence of social interactions by behavioral observation protocols and social network analyses. Bats preferentially interacted and affiliated with former group members regardless of species, showing that social bonding may occur between different species and that it develops after close contact with newborn heterospecifics, possibly through imprinting-like mechanisms. To our best knowledge, this is the first time such a phenomenon is documented for mammals. Although thermal preferences are often advocated to explain mixed-species associations among bats, individual experience may facilitate heterospecific groups in bats and other taxa.},

abstract = {Proximity to humans is a primary stressor for wildlife, especially in urban habitats where frequent disturbance may occur. Several bat species often roost in buildings but while the effects of disturbance inside the roost are well documented, little is known about those occurring in the proximity of roosts. We tested the effects of anthropogenic stressors on bats by monitoring reactions to disturbance in a colony of greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). We assessed disturbance by recording and quantifying the presence of people, domestic cats and noise sources near the roost. Disturbance outside the roost caused the disruption of roosting clusters; when cats entered the roost, bats decreased indoor flight activity. Emergence timing was delayed when people were close to the roost exit, and the delay increased along with the number of people. The occurrence of a cat increased the degree of group clustering during emergence. Cats entered the roost especially when young bats were present, and bat remains occurred in 30% of the cat scats we examined. We show that the occurence of human activities near roosts and free -ranging domestic cats are important albeit overlooked sources of disturbance.},

abstract = {We link spatially explicit climate change predictions to a dynamic metapopulation model. Predictions of species' responses to climate change, incorporating metapopulation dynamics and elements of dispersal, allow us to explore the range margin dynamics for two lagomorphs of conservation concern. Although the lagomorphs have very different distribution patterns, shifts at the edge of the range were more pronounced than shifts in the overall metapopulation. For Romerolagus diazi (volcano rabbit), the lower elevation range limit shifted upslope by approximately 700 m. This reduced the area occupied by the metapopulation, as the mountain peak currently lacks suitable vegetation. For Lepus timidus (European mountain hare), we modelled the British metapopulation. Increasing the dispersive estimate caused the metapopulation to shift faster on the northern range margin (leading edge). By contrast, it caused the metapopulation to respond to climate change slower, rather than faster, on the southern range margin (trailing edge). The differential responses of the leading and trailing range margins and the relative sensitivity of range limits to climate change compared with that of the metapopulation centroid have important implications for where conservation monitoring should be targeted. Our study demonstrates the importance and possibility of moving from simple bioclimatic envelope models to second-generation models that incorporate both dynamic climate change and metapopulation dynamics.},

abstract = {To better understand the importance of social activity, ultrasonic calls made by lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros) in North Wales, U.K. were recorded during extended pre-set periods since 2010 inside and outside nursery roosts from May to July and in a hibernaculum in October. Ultrasonic calls with fundamental frequencies between 15-42 kHz were identified as seven categories of infant development calls and 15 categories of adult ultrasonic social calls according to the frequency and duration of the fundamental, the number of harmonics and the number of calls in a sequence. Activities were monitored remotely using infrared video cameras with simultaneous time expansion sound recorders. Distinctive polyharmonic isolation calls of newborn R. hipposideros enabled timing of births to be determined and infant echolocation marked the time when they started to fly. Trill advertisement calls in the hibernaculum indicated mating behaviour in October. Comparison of call-triggered recording times enabled variable levels of activity to be determined quickly. The longest sonogram times were in July (50.2 min/h) and in June (49.1 min/h). During these recordings, 95 and 90 adults returned to the roost after foraging and there were 16 and 42 babies, respectively. In May sound and video recordings outside a nursery roost revealed ultrasonic social calls during the emergence of 200 adult R. hipposideros when the light level was low at two lux, which showed that R. hipposideros were engaged in social activity, not light sampling. Surveys of ten nursery roosts showed that this social behaviour was typical of R. hipposideros in Wales.},

abstract = {A nursery roost of the soprano pipstrelle bat Pipistrellus pygmaeus has been monitored continuously between 1 April and 27 September (Weeks 1-26) for 20 yr to promote conservation of the species, which declined over the last century. The long-term study, essential to estimate a reliable population trend, is linked to environmental changes as possible causes of decline. The main emergence was from May to July (Weeks 6-18) when 550 +/- 190 (SD) P. pygmaeus were counted. Analysis showed that the year-to-year change in population size of female P. pygmaeus (.N) and the time of the peak exit count of the females from the roost in May to June could be predicted from the integrated air temperature (degree days, D) between 1 January and 31 March. The regression of Delta N on D showed a statistically significant linear regression line defined by Delta N = 1.31-0.0015 D (R-2 = 38.4%; p = 0.005). Delta N = 1.04 to 1.33 reflected a stable to increasing population (Years 1-7 and 15-20). Delta N = 0.78 to 1.00 reflected a stable to decreasing population (Years 8-14). The regression of the time of the first peak exit count, calculated as the number of weeks from 1 April, on D showed a statistically significant linear regression line defined by Weeks = 12.75-0.020 D (R-2 = 32.8%; p = 0.008). Rising temperatures between January and March would be detrimental to P. pygmaeus populations.},

abstract = {Agricultural intensification was a major driver of declines in western European wildlife populations during the twentieth century, including those of bats. Agri-environment schemes are advocated as the key government-funded mechanism to restore biodiversity, but evidence for their effects has been mixed. We examined the response of six bat species to Tir Gofal (TG), a Welsh AES that operated from 1999 to 2011. A large-scale multi-site study compared bat activity and key habitat variables on TG farms paired with control farms not in the scheme. Observations were made over three years (2009 to 2011) using three types of bat detector survey. Pipistrellus pipistrellus, P. pygmaeus, Myotis daubentonii, Rhinolophus hipposideros and R. ferrumequinum showed similar overall and foraging activity on TG and control farms (occurrence, intensity of activity where present). Occurrence of Nyctalus noctula and Nyctalus group was also similar on both farm types, but where they were present, the intensity of their activity was higher on control farms. The lack of influence of TG status on bat activity may reflect the close similarity in occurrence and condition of many key habitats on the two farm types and should be seen in the context of a mainly traditional extensively farmed landscape. Habitat prescriptions may have been insufficiently mature, implemented at too low density or lacking roosting provision to stimulate a species response, or may have had greater impact in a more intensively farmed landscape where less high quality bat habitat was available. A more targeted approach to creating and enhancing field and landscape scale roosting, foraging and commuting resources may be needed to effect positive responses in bat populations.},

abstract = {We examined the biodiversity of urban habitats in Birmingham (England) using a combination of field surveys of plants and carabid beetles, genetic studies of four species of butterflies, modelling the anthropochorous nature of the floral communities and spatially explicit modelling of selected mammal species. The aim of the project was to: (i) understand the ecological characteristics of the biota of cities model, (ii) examine the effects of habitat fragment size and connectivity upon the ecological diversity and individual species distributions, (iii) predict biodiversity in cities, and (iv) analyse the extent to which the flora and fauna utilise the,urban greenways' both as wildlife corridors and as habitats in their own right. The results suggest that cities provide habitats for rich and diverse range of plants and animals, which occur sometimes in unlikely recombinant communities. The studies on carabids and butterflies illustrated the relative importance of habitat quality on individual sites as opposed to site location within the conurbation. This suggests that dispersal for most of our urban species is not a limiting factor in population persistence, although elements of the woodland carabid fauna did appear to have some geographical structuring. Theoretical models suggested that dormice and water voles may depend on linear habitats for dispersal. The models also indicated that other groups, such as small and medium sized mammals, may use corridors, although field-based research did not provide any evidence to suggest that plants or invertebrates use urban greenways for dispersal. This finding indicates the importance of identifying a target species or group of species for urban greenways intended as dispersal routeways rather than as habitat in their own right. Their importance for most groups is rather that greenways provide a chain of different habitats permeating the urban environment. We suggest that planners can have a positive impact on urban biodiversity by slowing the pace of redevelopment and by not hurrying to tidy up and redevelop brownfield sites. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Extra-group paternity (EGP) occurs commonly among group-living mammals and plays an important role in mating systems and the dynamics of sexual selection; however, socio-ecological and genetic correlates of EGP have been underexplored. We use 23years of demographic and genetic data from a high-density European badger (Meles meles) population, to investigate the relationship between the rate of EGP in litters and mate availability, mate incompatibility and mate quality (heterozygosity). Relatedness between within-group assigned mothers and candidate fathers had a negative quadratic effect on EGP, whereas the number of neighbouring-group candidate fathers had a linear positive effect. We detected no effect of mean or maximum heterozygosity of within-group candidate fathers on EGP. Consequently, EGP was associated primarily with mate availability, subject to within-group genetic effects, potentially to mitigate mate incompatibility and inbreeding. In badgers, cryptic female choice, facilitated by superfecundation, superfoetation and delayed implantation, prevents males from monopolizing within-group females. This resonates with a meta-analysis in group-living mammals, which proposed that higher rates of EGP occur when within-group males cannot monopolize within-group females. In contrast to the positive meta-analytic association, however, we found that EGP associated negatively with the number of within-group assigned mothers and the number of within-group candidate fathers; potentially a strategy to counter within-group males committing infanticide. The relationship between the rate of EGP and socio-ecological or genetic factors can therefore be intricate, and the potential for cryptic female choice must be accounted for in comparative studies.},

We know that dormice are nocturnal, arboreal, and avoid crossing open spaces between habitats, yet how they navigate around their canopy is unknown. As other rodents use whisker touch sensing to navigate and explore their environment, this study investigates whether Hazel dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius) employ their whiskers to cross between habitats. We analysed high-speed video footage of dormice exploring freely in flat and climbing arenas in near darkness and using infrared light illumination. We confirm that, like rats and mice, dormice move their whiskers back and forth continuously (similar to 10 Hz) in a motion called whisking and recruit them to explore small gaps (< 10 cm) by increasing the amplitude and frequency of whisking and also the asymmetry of movement between the left and right whisker fields. When gaps between platforms are larger than 10-15 cm, dormice spend more time travelling on the floor. These findings suggest that dormice can actively and purposively move their whiskers to gather relevant information from their canopy at night. As this species is vulnerable to threats on the ground, we also provide evidence that joining habitat patches between dormouse populations is important for promoting natural behaviours and movement between patches.},

Home-range boundaries of male foxes shifted towards the scent-marked area, but this change did not affect the total territory size. Larger males shifted their home ranges to a greater degree than small males. Scent application did not affect total activity, but males spent more time in the scent-marked area. Behaviors such as distance moved per night and speed of movement did not differ before and after application, but foxes searched a greater percentage of their home range each night following scent marking. Females showed no significant spatial or behavioral response to the synthetic scent marks.

abstract = {Niche partitioning through foraging is a mechanism likely involved in facilitating the coexistence of ecologically similar and co-occurring animal species by separating their use of resources. Yet, this mechanism is not well understood in flying insectivorous animals. This is particularly true of bats, where many ecologically similar or cryptic species coexist. The detailed analysis of the foraging niche in sympatric, cryptic sibling species provides an excellent framework to disentangle the role of specific niche factors likely involved in facilitating coexistence. We used DNA metabarcoding to determine the prey species consumed by a population of sympatric sibling Rhinolophus euryale and Rhinolophus mehelyi whose use of habitat in both sympatric and allopatric ranges has been well established through radio tracking. Although some subtle dietary differences exist in prey species composition, the diet of both bats greatly overlapped (O-jk=0.83) due to the consumption of the same common and widespread moths. Those dietary differences we did detect might be related to divergences in prey availabilities among foraging habitats, which prior radio tracking on the same population showed are differentially used and selected when both species co-occur. This minor dietary segregation in sympatry may be the result of foraging on the same prey-types and could contribute to reduce potential competitive interactions (e.g., for prey, acoustic space). Our results highlight the need to evaluate the spatial niche dimension in mediating the co-occurrence of similar insectivorous bat species, a niche factor likely involved in processes of bat species coexistence.},

abstract = {Although the pest status of the European Mole Talpa europaea L. in Britain has never been adequately assessed, it is perceived as being a pest of agricultural and amenity land and is widely persecuted. We review the Mole's pest status, and evaluate current and proposed control methods. While there has been a recent decline in the demand for strychnine, abuse of this poison leads annually to the death of many wild and domestic animals. The need remains for a humane, practical and safe alternative. If strychnine were banned without such an alternative being available, the use of mole-traps would probably increase. Through post-mortem examination of trapped Moles we evaluate the humaneness of these traps. Our returned questionnaires showed that, while most farmers perceive Moles as pests, the damage which is attributed to them is slight on the great majority of farms. Control of Moles was none the less common and widespread, and was undertaken by 49.5% of respondents in 1992. Perceived pest status and the favoured method of control varied regionally; these trends may be related to soil quality and cultivation type. Silage pollution was the most widely cited agricultural problem attributed to Moles. Practical measures to reduce silage pollution by Moles are discussed, particularly with regard to silage collection and treatment using bacteriophages. The efficiency of these additives merits detailed study because they have the potential, regardless of whether pollution has occurred or not, to improve the quality of the silage to an extent that killing Moles may be unnecessary; less than 1% of respondents reported that 10% or more of their silage was seriously affected by Mole activity.},

European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2), a rabies virus, has been detected in Daubenton's bats in the UK and continental Europe. Investigating the relatedness of colonies and gene flow between these regions would allow regional estimates of the movement of Daubenton's bats and thus the potential for disease transmission. The genetic structure of the Daubenton's bat in western Europe was investigated by analysing variability at eight microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was found to be high at all sites (H (E) = 0.73-0.84), with little differentiation between bats sampled in the UK and continental Europe. Mantel tests indicated a significant correlation between geographic distance and pair-wise F (ST) (P = 0.000), between colonies sampled in Scotland and northern England. However, this was not continuous throughout the sampled range, with evidence of panmixia within the area sampled in continental Europe. Assignment tests show no evidence that the (potential) EBLV-2 sero-positive and virus positive bats were more likely to have originated from the continental rather than UK populations. There is no sufficient significant genetic differentiation amongst most UK and continental colonies to conclude that EBLV-2 is maintained in the UK by immigration. Results show that it is likely to be maintained at a low endemic level within the UK. The relative genetic uniformity of UK and continental populations implies that there is no migration barrier to EBLV-2, between these regions.},

At all seasons, the ranges in the sand‐dunes were much larger than those in the woodland. Male ranges were larger than female ranges, especially so in the breeding season. In the non‐breeding season, sexual differences in range sizes could be accounted for by the greater energy requirements of the larger males. During the breeding season, males expanded their ranges, probably in an attempt to find receptive females.},

abstract = {Context. Some species that are perceived by certain stakeholders as a valuable resource can also cause ecological or economic damage, leading to contrasting management objectives and subsequent conflict between stakeholder groups. There is increasing recognition that the integration of stakeholder knowledge with formal scientific data can enhance the information available for use in management. This is especially true where scientific understanding is incomplete, as is frequently the case for wide-ranging species, which can be difficult to monitor directly at the landscape scale. Aims. The aim of the research was to incorporate stakeholder knowledge with data derived from formal quantitative models to modify predictions of wildlife distribution and abundance, using wild deer in the UK as an example. Methods. We use selected predictor variables from a deer-vehicle collision model to estimate deer densities at the 10-km square level throughout the East of England. With these predictions as a baseline, we illustrate the use of participatory GIS as a methodological framework for enabling stakeholder participation in the refinement of landscape-scale deer abundance maps. Key results. Stakeholder participation resulted in modi. cations to modelled abundance patterns for all wild deer species present in the East of England, although the modi. cations were minor and there was a high degree of consistency among stakeholders in the adjustments made. For muntjac, roe and fallow deer, the majority of stakeholder changes represented an increase in density, suggesting that populations of these species are increasing in the region. Conclusions. Our results show that participatory GIS is a useful technique for enabling stakeholders to contribute to incomplete scientific knowledge, especially where up-to-date species distribution and abundance data are needed to inform wildlife research and management. Implications. The results of the present study will serve as a valuable information base for future research on deer management in the region. The flexibility of the approach makes it applicable to a range of species at different spatial scales and other wildlife conflict issues. These may include the management of invasive species or the conservation of threatened species, where accurate spatial data and enhanced community involvement are necessary in order to facilitate effective management.},

journal = {Biological Conservation},

pages = {214-222},
abstract = {The management of wildlife and its impacts on biodiversity is likely to be most successful where ecological understanding is integrated with the economic and social drivers for management, and where the attitudes and behaviour of stakeholders are fully understood. Collaboration between stakeholders at the landscape level is suggested as the most efficient 'model' for the management of many wildlife species such as deer. However, there has been limited research to evaluate the effectiveness of collaborative management for deer or how it is perceived by individual landowners. Here, we take an integrative quantitative and qualitative approach to evaluate the relative importance of different ecological and social drivers for management in determining the impacts of deer on woodland sites managed for conservation objectives in the East of England, UK. Our results suggest that the ecological impacts of deer are widely recognised amongst landowners, with many management decisions based on observations of site ecology. Furthermore, current financial incentives serve as an important motivation for land owners to actively manage deer. We found no evidence that deer management focused at the level of individual sites is effective for achieving ecological management objectives. In contrast, collaborative management with neighbouring land owners can help to reduce conservation impacts, especially in relation to the larger deer species. The study highlights the importance of landscape-scale collaborative management in delivering conservation objectives. It also demonstrates the importance of understanding social factors, alongside ecological ones, in designing effective conservation management strategies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The range and abundance of the pine marten Martes martes and red fox Vulpes vulpes are considered to have increased in the Scottish Highlands in recent decades. In 2009, we resurveyed 11 forests surveyed for predators in 1995, together with an additional five forests. Our survey techniques followed those used in 1995. In all, we used DNA analysis to identify 414 mammal scats, representing 30% of the scats collected and identified in the field as being from either fox or marten. Of these, 77% of scats had been identified correctly by two field observers, with no difference between the individual observers. However, of the scats incorrectly identified, there was a bias towards identifying marten scats as fox scats. We used DNA confirmation to obtain correction formulae for scats identified in the field as fox or martens. The corrected marten sign index had increased 3.9-fold since 1995 and the fox sign index had increased 2.2-fold in the 11 forests surveyed in both years.},

abstract = {1. The effect of grazing by red deer was assessed in eight native pinewoods in the Scottish Highlands in 1991 and 1992 by comparing ground vegetation and invertebrate communities in grazed forest with adjacent ungrazed deer exclosures. 2. Grazing was associated with less heather cover and more grass. Bilberry cover remained the same, but grazed bilberry was half the height of ungrazed bilberry and had almost twice as many of its apical tips removed by grazing. 3. Lepidopterous larvae formed 60% of all invertebrates. Four species comprised 96% of larvae, those of Hydriomena furcata were most numerous (39%). 4. Forests in the West (Argyll) had, on average, more than seven times fewer lepidopterous larvae than those in the East (Deeside). Rates of decrease towards the West differed between species. 5. On average, numbers of lepidopterous larvae in grazing exclosures were almost 4-fold higher, Hymenoptera, chiefly ants Formica rufa 3-fold higher, and Coleoptera, Aranaea, Diptera and Plecoptera all 2-fold higher than in grazed forest. 6. The importance of deer grazing and tree density in determining larval abundance and their subsequent potential for affecting insectivorous birds in pinewoods are discussed.},

abstract = {The potential impact of population bottlenecks and founder events on genetic diversity and indirect measures of fitness (such as fluctuating asymmetry; FA) has important conservation implications. Here we take advantage of historical events that generated a remnant roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) population in the north of the British Isles that retained diversity, while populations in the south were apparently extirpated during the early mediaeval era. The southern population was later re-established from small founder populations of introduced European roe deer starting in the 19th century. We assess the impact of these events, using the northern remnant population as a reference, based on measures of FA at 16 bilateral cranial traits. Comparing the northern and southern populations we find evidence of differential impact on both the level of FA and the relationship between FA and levels of genetic diversity.

We examined traffic-related mortality of red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the city of Bristol, UK, and the extent to which roads affected fox activity by comparing real and randomly generated patterns of movement. There were significant seasonal differences in the number of traffic-related fox deaths for different age and sex classes; peaks were associated with periods when individuals were likely to be moving through unfamiliar terrain and would have had to cross major roads. Mortality rates per unit road length increased with road magnitude. The number of roads crossed by foxes and the rate at which roads were crossed per hour of activity increased after midnight when traffic flow was lower. Adults and juveniles crossed 17% and 30% fewer roads, respectively, than expected from randomly generated movement. This highly mobile species appeared to reduce the mortality risk of minor category roads by changing its activity patterns, but it remained vulnerable to the effects of larger roads with higher traffic flows during periods associated with extraterritorial movements.},

abstract = {Forests within agricultural landscapes can act as safe harbourages for species that conflict with neighbouring landowners' interests, including mammalian predators. The agency responsible for the management of forests in upland Wales, UK, has permitted the killing of foxes (Vulpes vulpes) on their land as a "good neighbour policy" with the aim of reducing fox numbers. The principal method used was the use of dogs to drive foxes to a line of waiting shooters; a small number of foxes were also killed by shooting at night with a rifle. However, it has been postulated that recent restrictions on the use of dogs to kill foxes in Britain could lead to an increase in fox numbers in plantations. The aim of this study was to determine whether over-winter culling (i.e. driving foxes to guns using dogs and rifle shooting) in these forests acted to reduce fox density. Fox faecal density counts were conducted in commercial forests in Wales in autumn 2003 and spring 2004. Data were analysed from 29 sites (21 individual forests and 8 forest blocks, the latter consisting of pooled data from 20 individual forests). The over-winter change in faecal density was negatively related to the proportion of felled land and the proportion of land more than 400 m altitude, these associations probably reflecting reduced food availability. Over-winter change was positively associated with culling pressure (i.e. more foxes were killed where more foxes were present, or vice versa), but this was not significant. The number of foxes killed was large relative to the estimated resident population, but losses appeared to be negated (most likely) by immigration. Pre-breeding (spring) faecal density counts were significantly positively related to culling pressure, i.e. more foxes were killed with increased fox density or vice versa. Overall, there was no evidence to suggest that culling reduced fox numbers. Consequently, restrictions on the use of dogs to control foxes are unlikely to result in an increase in fox numbers in commercial forests.},

We utilized data from a population of known size and structure to quantify differences in the seasonal capture rate of foxes Vulpes vulpes of different age, sex and social status. The effects of home-range utilization and trap experience were also investigated. 2. The capture rate of juvenile (< 1 years) foxes was highest in spring and declined throughout the year. Adult (<greater than or equal to> 1 years) trap rates were equivalent to those of juveniles in winter. 3. Neither juveniles nor adults exhibited sex differences in trappability. 4. Adults were classified as dominant or subordinate based upon patterns of dyadic interaction. Subordinate foxes were trapped more frequently than dominants. 5. Trappability did not differ inside or outside of core areas, after controlling for trap effort. 6. Previous trap experience did not affect the capture rate of adult foxes. 7. Captures of non-resident foxes peaked in winter (52% of captures), associated with dispersing juveniles and adult males, and were lowest in summer (13%). 8. In Britain, 75-90% of foxes would need to consume poison or vaccine baits to control a rabies epizooty. During simulated rabies control operations, where cage-trapping was used to measure the proportion of foxes taking dummy baits containing a biomarker, < 30% of foxes consumed baits. However, non-resident foxes present during the period of baiting but not during trapping, or vice versa, may bias these calculations. We used the frequency of capture of non-resident foxes to re-examine the success rate of these trials. 9. Revised estimates still suggest that < 45% of foxes were reached during the simulated control operations. This is significantly below the levels necessary for rabies control. Further biomarker trials are required that do not rely only on trapping for sample collection and where the residency status of captured foxes has been determined.},

abstract = {1. Counts of road traffic casualties (RTCs) have been proposed as one potential method of monitoring changes in the abundance of several mammal species in Britain. However, before such schemes are implemented, it is vital that the relationship between animal density and RTCs is verified and quantified. In this paper, we analyse data collected as part of a long-term study of red foxes Vulpes vulpes in Bristol, UK to determine whether RTCs reflected changes in fox numbers. 2. Associations between fox density and RTC counts were examined using data collected from throughout Bristol during 1978-84 (spatial model) and from an intensive longitudinal study in the north-west of the city during 1990-94 (temporal model). For both sets of data, there was a significant relationship between fox density and RTCs; in the case of the temporal model, this was only evident after the data had been manipulated by calculating running means across seasons. These regression models only explained 58% and 43% of the variance observed in the data, respectively. 3. In both analyses, there was a significant difference between the distribution of casualties and the availability of different road types; more foxes were killed on major category roads (e.g. motorways, A-roads). Incorporating the length of each road category in each region in the spatial model improved the variance explained to 81%. This level of precision would be sufficient for a national monitoring programme. However, we were able to minimize or eliminate a number of factors that could potentially confound the use of RTCs for a national monitoring programme; these factors are discussed in detail. At present, we conclude that further investigation into the validity and precision of this technique is required for a range of mammal species before it could be used in a national monitoring programme.},

journal = {European Journal of Wildlife Research},

abstract = {Translocation is currently used as a last resort mitigation strategy for water voles (Arvicola amphibius) in the UK (Dean et al. 2016), where populations have undergone widespread declines during the past century. To increase the chances of success, current guidance suggests translocation of voles during autumn should not be carried out as individuals may be at higher risk of overwinter mortality, and instead should be overwintered in captivity for release the following spring. To verify this guidance, we carried out a mark recapture and radiotracking study of an autumn translocated and resident population in lowland England. Whilst we found translocated voles undertook longer exploratory movements than residents and those previously recorded in spring, there was no evidence from our study that translocated voles suffered higher mortality rates compared to the resident individuals. The turnover in both populations was high with 25% and 8% of the translocated and resident individuals being recaptured in spring. Younger voles that were not collared had a significantly higher chance of being recaptured in spring and their survival and settlement on the receptor channel is considered important as this is the age class that will produce most of the following years' young. Mean weekly distances moved by collared voles showed no pattern of stabilisation, in either sex, over the 10-week monitoring period and combined dispersal from both study populations accounted for 26% of those that were not recaptured in spring. However, due to low sample size, we were unable to distinguish between the effects of dispersal and mortality. We conclude that where individuals or populations will be negatively impacted by planned development, autumn translocations in lowland England may offer a feasible alternative to housing animals in captivity, given the high financial cost and additional health and welfare risks associated with a captive environment. The receptor site and adjacent habitat (>1km) would need to support a seasonal abundance of food and cover, be connected to existing populations and be part of a wider landscape that is mink free and under an effective mink control programme to help secure long-term population viability. We advise, however, that due to our small sample size, further studies are undertaken to confirm our findings.},

pages = {531-546},
abstract = {An important consideration when implementing species management is preserving genetic variation, which is fundamental to the long-term persistence of populations and adaptive potential of the species. The European water vole Arvicola amphibius is of high conservation importance in the United Kingdom due to its documented decline in both distribution and abundance. Conservation strategies for this species include protecting source populations, increasing habitat availability and connectivity, non-native predator control and reintroduction. We used mtDNA control region sequences and eight microsatellite markers from samples collected from 12 localities in southeast England, to determine how genetic variation is structured amongst regional water vole populations and to what extent population structure has been influenced by reintroductions. We found high haplotype diversity (h) across native populations in the southeast region and evidence that divergent lineages had been introduced to the region. We detected significant structure between watersheds with mtDNA from native populations and evidence of finer scale structure between populations within watersheds with both mtDNA and microsatellites. We suggest that management strategies should aim to conserve genetic diversity at a population level and that watersheds are a practicable unit for prioritising management within regions. We propose that introductions to restore or augment water voles within watersheds should consider the genetic composition of regional populations and highlight that genetic data has an important role in guiding future conservation options that secure adaptive potential in the face of future environmental change.},

volume = {42},

pages = {921-931},
abstract = {1. Non-lethal methods of controlling wildlife foraging damage may offer conservation, ethical, legal and efficacy advantages over lethal control. Chemical repellents present a potential non-lethal approach, but have not been adequately researched in natural environments. Many previous studies have been poorly designed and a lack of data on individual behavioural responses has limited the practical development of repellents. We aimed to identify effective repellents for resolving feeding conflict with wild mammals, using European badgers Meles meles as models. 2. We tested the relative efficacy of capsaicin, cinnamamide and ziram, in a multichoice paradigm, using remote video-surveillance to obtain detailed behavioural observations of known free-ranging individuals. Treatment nights were alternated with control nights over 56 nights. 3. Badgers discriminated precisely between the four treatments, demonstrating a clear preference for untreated baits, followed by cinnamamide and capsaicin (in no particular order) and then ziram. 4. All untreated baits, and baits treated with capsaicin or cinnamamide, were eaten throughout the trial. 5. Ziram baits were fully consumed on treatment nights 1 and 2. Ziram consumption then declined to zero between treatment nights 3 and 9, this coinciding with a sharp rise in bait patch rejection. This 'learning curve' peaked at treatment night 7. We conclude that badgers developed conditioned taste aversion towards ziram-treated baits at this point. Ziram bait consumption was practically zero over the last 20 treatment nights (40 trial nights) and individuals avoided ziram baits, without sampling, for the last 12-22 treatment nights (24-44 trial nights). Observed changes in badger behaviour suggested that avoidance at a distance was facilitated by odour cues. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study provides proof of the concept that ziram has clear potential for reducing badger feeding damage through conditioned taste aversion to an odour. Our detailed observations allowed us to elucidate the behavioural mechanism involved, crucial for directing future development of this approach, thus demonstrating the importance of studying individual responses in wildlife management research. Second-order conditioning, such as this, might be applicable to managing other wild mammals. The next step will be to develop a strategy for use in wildlife damage situations.},

abstract = {Moles are widely trapped as pests on farms and amenity land in Britain. Spring traps for killing mammals generally require welfare approval in the UK, but mole traps are exempt. Previous research demonstrated wide variation in the mechanical performance of mole traps. In this context, we aimed to produce new data on the welfare impact of kill-trapping moles in the field. We collected 50 moles trapped in southern England (November 2008-August 2009). Captures peaked during the peak in male breeding activity, when captures were almost exclusively male. Post mortem and x-ray (radiation) examinations were conducted to determine injuries and likely cause of death. No moles sustained damaged skulls or upper cervical vertebrae (which could cause unconsciousness immediately). The primary identifiable cause of death for all but one mole was acute haemorrhage; this contrasts with the findings of the only previous such study, in which only one mole showed clear evidence of haemorrhaging. Some moles may have asphyxiated although it was not possible to determine this. Moles most likely became unconscious before death, but times to unconsciousness, and death, can be determined only through killing trials and further investigation is urgently needed. This should be done through the spring traps approval process; this could improve the welfare standards of trapping for many thousands of moles each year. Mole trapping for long-term population control might be better targeted after the peak in male breeding activity, when females are more likely to be caught, but this would threaten the welfare of dependent young underground.},

The wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, was the dominant species caught on the fields and the only species found to have consumed measurable quantities of seed. Voles, Microtus agrestis and Clethrionomys glareolus, were caught in small numbers, almost exclusively in the field hedge, and showed no evidence of having consumed seed. Stomach-contents analysis revealed that more than 80% of animals trapped in the hedge adjacent to the field had consumed no wheat seed, whereas 98% had consumed less than 10% (by stomach volume). Ninety percent of animals trapped on the field had consumed seed, although 90% of these animals had less than 20% seed in the stomach. Residues of the fungicide in the stomach, intestine, and liver were lower than would be expected for the amount of seed consumed, possibly because of dehusking of the seeds by mice. The relevance of these findings when assessing exposure (and risk) posed by seed treatments to wild mammals is discussed.},

abstract = {Energy availability and energy use directly influence an organism's life history, fitness and ecological function. In wild animals, abiotic factors such as ambient temperature, season and rainfall, and biotic factors such as body mass, age, social group size and disease status, all potentially influence energy balance. Relatively few studies have examined the effects of disease on the energy expenditure of wild animals. Such studies could further our understanding of factors influencing the transmission of zoonotic diseases. The European badger (Meles meles) is a medium-sized carnivore that occurs in mixed-sex, familial groups across much of its range. In the UK, they are a protected species but are also involved in the epidemiology of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle. We measured the daily energy expenditure (DEE) and resting metabolic rate (RMR) of wild badgers and related this to their TB infection status and a range of other interacting factors including season, group size, disease status, sex, age, body mass and body fat. Individuals were larger and fatter when they were older, and fatter during the winter. Males were also heavier than females during the summer. In addition, individuals from smaller groups that were exposed to TB tended to have lower body mass. There were no direct effects of disease status on DEE or RMR; however, there was a significant interaction whereby DEE increased with body mass in small groups but decreased with body mass in large groups. Results are consistent with the costs of TB infection being met by compensatory mechanisms enabling badgers to survive for extended periods without exhibiting measurable energetic consequences.},

abstract = {The pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) occurs as two phonic types in the British Isles, termed the 45 kHz phonic type and the 55 kHz phonic type. The two types are probably sibling species and therefore may have different diets. The aim of this study was to investigate differences in the diets of the two phonic types by using faecal analysis. Droppings were collected from three roosts of the 45 kHz phonic type and three roosts of the 55 kHz phonic type in three standardized time-periods during June and July 1994. Prey remains were identified in each sample as far as possible to the class, order, or family level, and the Percentage Items of each prey group in the diet of each phonic type was calculated. Analyses of variance were carried out to investigate the effects of time-period and roost on dietary composition, and to determine differences in the diets of the two phonic types for the main prey groups found. Both phonic types ate mostly the dipteran suborder Nematocera, and there was no difference between the phonic types in dietary breadth. The main prey groups in the diet of bats of the 45 kHz phonic type were the families Psychodidae, Anisopodidae and Muscidae, whereas the main prey groups of bats of the 55 kHz phonic type were the families Chironomidae and Ceratopogonidae. Differences in the diets of the two phonic types are discussed with respect to differences in habitat use by, and differences in echolacation call frequencies of, the two phonic types. The reported dietary differences support the hypothesis that the two phonic types are sibling species.},

Long-term monitoring of bat populations is therefore fundamental to verifying environmental change over time. Although in the past, significant declines in bat populations have been reported across Europe, only limited data are available from systematic monitoring schemes over long periods. In this study we use data from the National Bat Monitoring Programme, a citizen science scheme drawing on over 3500 volunteers, to estimate changes in populations across Great Britain for 10 bat species or species groups between 1997 and 2012. We demonstrate uniquely how data collected on relative abundance and activity of bats by volunteers at 3272 sites using standardised, multiple survey methods (counts at roosts and bat detector surveys using tuneable, heterodyne detectors) can be successfully utilised to produce statistically robust population indices for a large proportion of a country's bat fauna. All trends calculated, with the exception of one species (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), had sufficient power to detect Red Alert level declines. Our results reveal a generally favourable picture for bats over the monitoring period; all species showed a stable or increasing trend from at least one survey type, although for four species where there were multiple trends from different survey types, the trend directions did not agree (Myotis nattereri, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Eptesicus serotinus). This study demonstrates that use of volunteer programmes can be successful in monitoring bat populations, provided that key features including standardised survey,methods and volunteer training are incorporated. Some species that are more difficult to detect and identify may however require specialist surveillance techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The study aimed to determine whether the so-called social calls that are produced by foraging bats of two phonic types of Pipistrellus pipistrellus serve a social function. First, the relationship between insect availability and the rate of production of social calls was measured at a foraging site of both phonic types. Second, playback experiments of social calls of the two phonic types were conducted in the field to determine the response of foraging bats to these calls, and to determine whether the calls are used in communication within or between phonic types. Two hypotheses are suggested for the function of social calls: that they may be used either to attract other bats to a food patch, or in agonistic interactions between bats in defence of a food patch. At relatively low insect densities, the rate of social call production of both phonic types increased significantly as insect density decreased. When social calls of each phonic type were broadcast, there was a significant reduction in bat activity of the same phonic type. In contrast, playbacks of social calls resulted in no change in activity of the other phonic type. The results supported the food patch defence hypothesis, that social calls are used to warn off other bats of the same phonic type when insects are scarce. The results also supported the hypothesis that the two phonic types are sibling species. Social calls were shown to serve a social function in intraspecific communication, but there was no communication between phonic types. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Songflight calls produced by males in the mating season, probably to attract females, differed between the two phonic types in the number of components in the calls and the call parameters measured. Songflight calls of the 55 kHz phonic type, which generally consisted of three components, were of higher frequencies than those of the 45 kHz phonic type, usually of four components. There were also significant differences in call parameters among individuals. A discriminant analysis of songflight calls classified 100% of individuals to the correct phonic type. The relationships between echolocation call frequency and songflight call frequency differed significantly between phonic types. Social calls produced during flight also differed between phonic types, in the number of components and call parameters measured. Social calls were compared to songflight calls of each phonic type. Social calls of the 55 kHz phonic type did not differ significantly from songflight calls; there were small but significant differences between the two types of calls of the 45 kHz phonic type. The study provides support for the hypothesis that the phonic types should be treated as sibling species. If songflight calls are used for mate choice, the differences may allow reproductive isolation between the two phonic types. The functions of songflight calls and social calls need to be investigated through experimental studies to explain the implications of the differences between phonic types.},

abstract = {Can ecological relationships between bat species be predicted largely on the basis of morphology? This question was addressed by investigating skull morphology of two cryptic species of the pipistrelle bat. Since 45 Pipistrellus pipistrellus apparently eats larger prey than 55 P. pipistrellus, we predicted that it would have a larger overall skull size, a larger dentary apparatus, and a larger gape. To test these predictions, variables were measured from skulls of the two cryptic species, and comparisons made between them. In accordance with our predictions, overall skull size was larger in 45 P. pipistrellus than in 55 P. pipistrellus, and 45 P. pipistrellus had a longer lower jaw and the distance between the jaws at maximum gape was larger. In addition, 45 P. pipistrellus had longer upper canines, which may allow it to pierce harder prey items than 55 P. pipistrellus Only some aspects of dietary differences between the two cryptic species could be explained by differences in skull morphology, and we suggest that empirical data, at least on diet and habitat use, are also required to explain mechanisms of resource partitioning among species in bat communities.},

abstract = {Any decision an animal makes about a course of action costs time so that time itself can be regarded as a constraint on the options open to the animal at any moment. Using common shrews, Sorex araneus L, searching for two types of prey (profitable and unprofitable) on a grid, some of the predictions of a model proposed by Lucas (1985) to take account of the effect of time constraints on diet selection were tested. The predictions of the model as it applies to bouts in which a predator can take several prey items and for which the duration is known to the predator in advance of foraging were partly supported. Shrews were unselective during short (3- and 6-min) bouts but selective during long (9-min) bouts. Selectivity increased towards the middle of 9-min bouts but remained low throughout 3- and 6-min bouts. In contrast to the predictions of classical optimal foraging theory, but in keeping with those of Lucas' (1985) time constraint model for known-time, multi-prey bouts, prey selection was influenced by encounter rates with both types of prey. In all three bout lengths, the proportion of both types of prey taken on encounter decreased with time into a bout. However, there was no evidence that selectivity decreased towards the end of a bout as a function of time remaining as predicted by the model. Discriminant function analysis suggested that variables related to current intake during a bout, rather than the amount of time left, determined whether or not prey were taken on encounter. The results are interpreted in terms of satiation and changing behavioural priorities with time into a bout.},

abstract = {We sent out a targeted questionnaire to organizations and private individuals across the UK that have expressed an interest in squirrel management and conservation. Respondents were asked to evaluate shooting, trapping, poisoning and immunocontraception (IMC), according to their perceived efficacy, cost efficiency, and whether they were considered to be humane. The majority of both professionals and enthusiasts indicated support for grey squirrel control to help conserve red squirrels and to reduce economic damage to timber crops. Respondents' comparative evaluations of current forms of control showed that trapping is the most acceptable method. When IMC is compared with the other methods, it was considered to be more humane and acceptable. In contrast, poisoning was seen as humane or acceptable by the fewest respondents. Furthermore, poisoning elicited the greatest difference in opinion between the professional and enthusiast groups. This difference (34%) may be interpreted partly as concern over the type of death that results from poisoning and partly as due to the possibility of poisoning nontarget species. Our findings indicate a need for more public information regarding secondary poisoning hazards to other species and their predators. Interest and concern about squirrel control correlated with the overlap between contemporary areas of distribution of the two species. It is these areas where consultation and education programs about control methods should be targeted. This research indicates that there would be support for grey squirrel control using IMC from both lay and professional interest groups. It demonstrates the existence of a sound basis for constructive dialog that can lead to the design and implementation of acceptable and efficient control strategies.},

The number of individuals caught decreased in winter and new individuals appeared during the next spring although the population crashed in July 1997 due to mink predation. The sex ratio was similar to that reported elsewhere for British populations, but densities were lower than those reported elsewhere. Body size was smaller than previously recorded in the same catchment. Home ranges were significantly smaller in summer than in spring resembling situations of high and low densities respectively Individuals showed restricted movements and no dispersal event was recorded.

abstract = {One hundred and sixty-one river sites throughout the Thames catchment area were surveyed during the summer of 1995 and a number of habitat features were recorded in order to identify relevant habitat variables for the water vole (Arvicola terrestris; Arvicolidae). In addition, the role of the American mink (Mustela vison; Mustelidae) in determining the present distribution of water voles in the Thames region was investigated. The data were analysed by using generalized linear models (GLM). Water voles were found in places characterised by low banks, unmodified channels, vegetated bars, submerged vegetation and were tolerant of moderate levels of bank reinforcement. The presence of mink was the most important variable. The results suggest that the American mink is the main factor determining the current distribution of water voles in this area. Restoration and recreation of habitat for water voles are likely to be a powerful tool in the recovery of water vole populations. It is hypothesised that mink control will be necessary only while the water vole population is small; once the population starts to increase both species could co-exist provided that the habitat is suitable.},

(5) This is an indication that stream banks in otter havens should have dense herbaceous vegetation and fringes of trees (e.g. alder) with branches hanging low near the water. Destruction of riverside vegetation, through for example grazing by domestic stock and access by people, should be prevented. (6) The influence on spraint densities of the vegetation on the two banks of the river, which is about 20 m wide in this area, is apparently independent. Conserving one bank may provide a good start for an otter haven. Vegetation up to 50 m behind the bank should be protected as well as within 0-5 m of the river's edge.},

abstract = {Organic farming is a whole-farm management approach believed to encourage biodiversity by excluding the input of agrochemicals and introducing specific management regimes for non-crop habitats. We examined the impact of the hedgerow management regime encouraged for organic farms on small mammal populations, since small mammal numbers influence a range of species at higher trophic levels and, in particular, are key to the conservation of a range of mammalian and avian predators. We compared differences in management and structure of non-crop habitats at the farm-scale between organic and conventional farms, and used within-farm variations in hedgerow size to predict the effect of hedgerow size on small mammals on both farm types. There were no significant differences in the proportion of non-crop habitats between organic and conventional farms, although management differences produced larger hedgerows on organic farms and greater diversity of hedgerow growth stages. However, a difference in hedgerow size between the farm types did not have a significant effect on small mammal abundance or diversity. We conclude that increased hedgerow size is not benefiting small mammal populations on organic farms: significant gains in small mammal numbers may be more effectively achieved by increasing the area of non-crop habitats rather than by improving management regimes.

A monitoring network for UK terrestrial mammals, the Tracking Mammals Partnership, is currently being set up to provide a coordinated programme to collect surveillance and monitoring data. 2. Monitoring UK mammals is important for a number of reasons including: setting conservation priorities; measuring the effects of conservation management; managing populations of problem species and the sustainable use of game species; assessing the effects of agriculture and other human activities; providing evidence for the need for policy change; and because of obligations under intergovernmental treaties and national legislation. 3. The bird world, largely but not solely through the work carried out by the British Trust for Ornithology, has provided a useful model for mammal surveillance and some important lessons in setting up and running a UK wide multispecies monitoring programme. 4. Lessons include the importance: of annual monitoring; of long-term data sets of population indices rather than absolute population sizes; and of the use of volunteers in data collection. 5. Two scoping studies have been carried out to assess the feasibility and costs of setting up a mammal surveillance and monitoring network and the survey methods that could be used for different species. 6. The Tracking Mammals Partnership, comprising 23 organizations, has the remit of implementing the recommendations of the scoping studies. There are a number of programmes operating within the Partnership including the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme, the National Bat Monitoring Programme and the Breeding Bird Survey Mammal Monitoring. There are also a number of pilot schemes being tested. 7. Reports on the population trend data collected should enable more informed policy and management decisions concerning UK mammal species.},

Empirical support for the idea has been seriously lacking, especially for endemic infections in natural hosts, but is provided here for cowpox virus infection in bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), using alternative descriptions of transmission dynamics: true and pseudo mass action. The former appears, overall, to give a better description of the dynamics. Transmission rates differ in two natural populations, but both support previously untested theories on the allometric scaling of transmission rates.},

abstract = {1. The population dynamics of bank voles and wood mice, and of cowpox virus infection in these two species, was studied over a 2-year period in a mainland population and in 14 nearby island populations of varying sizes. 2. For both species, there was no intrinsic variation in the pattern of host dynamics with island size: small island populations behaved as though they were small subsamples of a larger population, displaying no more than the expected random variation from the general pattern. 3. None the less, the relative numbers of bank voles to wood mice increased markedly with decreasing island size; and bank vole densities tended to be higher on smaller islands. 4. Only 22 animals were discovered to have moved either between islands or between the mainland and the islands, out of 1883 captured in all. None the less, it was apparent that males were more likely to move than females. 5. Overall patterns of cowpox virus dynamics were similar in all cases. However, on all islands there were extended periods when cowpox virus infection was apparently absent, and on the small islands the numbers of infected individuals were mostly very low and in many cases infection was never found. 6. For both host species, there was no evidence for a threshold population size for cowpox virus (critical community size) in terms of density, but clear evidence for one in terms of the numerical size of populations. This suggests little support for density-dependent transmission, despite this having been the usual default assumption for non-sexually transmitted infections. 7. There was also evidence for a separate invasion threshold (between ecological and epidemiological invasion) and persistence threshold (between epidemiological invasion and persistence). This is contrary to the output of the most-quoted (deterministic) models - persistence and invasion threshold one and the same - highlighting the fact that little attention has been paid in the past to the practical meaning of the theoretical concept of a threshold. 8. In the case of the wood mice, a superficial similarity to the bank vole thresholds was potentially misleading. Wood mouse thresholds were influenced at least as much by the bank vole thresholds as they were by the dynamics within the wood mouse populations themselves.},

abstract = {Helminth parasites were studied in the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, in southern England in September of each of four successive years (1994-1997). Nine species of helminths were recorded: five nematodes (Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Syphacia stroma, Pelodera strongyloides, Trichuris muris, Capillaria murissylvatici), two cestodes (Microsomacanthus crenata, Taenia taeniaeformis) and two trematodes (Corrigia vitta, Brachylaemus recurvum). In total, 134 mice were examined and 91.8% carried at least one species of helminth. The majority of mice carried two to three species (60.5%) and the highest combination was six of the nine species recorded in the study. The patterns of between-year variations in the prevalence and abundance of infection were different for each of the six species for which sufficient quantitative data were available to enable statistical analysis. For H, polygyrus, the most important source of variation arose from between-year differences, host age and. the interaction of these factors: abundance increased with host age but in 1995 the age pattern was markedly different from that in the remaining years. The abundance of C. vitta also varied significantly between years but additionally there was a strong independent age effect. For M. crenata, the year x age interaction was significant, indicating that abundance among different age cohorts varied from year to year but there was also a weak significant main effect of age arising from the youngest age cohort carrying no parasites and the oldest age cohort the heaviest infections. For P, strongyloides the only significant factor was between-year variation with 1995 being a year of exceptionally low prevalence and abundance of infection. No significant between-year variation was detected for S. stroma but there was a strong sex effect (males carrying heavier infections) and an age effect (older mice of both sexes carrying heavier infections). The abundance of Trichuris muris varied only in relation to host age, worm burdens growing in intensity with increasing age, but there was also a significant interaction between year and host sex with respect to prevalence. For the remaining three species, the prevalence of infections was too low (<8.2%) to enable any meaningful interpretation. This analysis emphasizes the need for carefully controlled statistical procedures in aiding the interpretation and the prioritization of the factors affecting worm burdens in wild rodents.},

abstract = {Reproduction in a population of European wild rabbits occupying parkland habitat in East Anglia showed an annual seasonality in terms of numbers of emergent young, male testes size and an index of female oestrous status. Weather conditions showed marked variation over the four-year study period with significantly higher minimum ground temperatures and hours of daily sunshine, and less snowfall recorded during the second two years. Parallel shifts in reproductive seasonality were found with male testes size peaking in January and February as opposed to May and April, first female oestrus recorded one month earlier (January compared to February), and young emerging over an average of 5.5 instead of 4.5 months each year and their first appearance above ground advanced by two months from April to February. Mean annual productivity increased from 7.2 and 6.1 emergent young per female, to 10.1 and 9.1 over the four years, while the number of adults present in the population at the start of the breeding season increased from 22 to 45, with females always outnumbering males. The usefulness is demonstrated of a non-invasive index of vulva appearance, and morphometric measures of testes to determine female oestrous status and estimates of male testicular weight in wild populations. The reported changes in reproduction are probably mediated through the influence of climatic variables on the quality or quantity of food available to the rabbits. These data demonstrate the possible effects of predicted global warming on productivity in the rabbit and highlight the major influence of climate on reproductive seasonality in this important pest species.},

We investigate the effect of different disease parameters on the replacement time of a native species by an alien invader. The outcome is critically dependent on the relative effects that the disease has on the two species and less dependent on the basic epidemiological characteristics of the interaction. This framework is also used to investigate the effect of disease on the spatial spread of the invader. Our results show an interesting phenomenon where a wave of disease spreads through the landscape ahead of the wave of replacement.},

Five rodent and three shrew species were live-trapped on 14 road verges in late summer 1994 and nine verges in autumn 1996 in north Cambridgeshire, UK. On average, between three and four species were captured per verge. Bank Voles Clethrionomys glareolus, Wood Mice Apodemus sylvaticus and Field Voles Microtus agrestis were the most abundant species, with mean densities of 45.5, 40.2 and 29.5 animals km(-1) in summer and 52.8, 181.9 and 47.2 animals km(-1) in autumn. Numbers varied between verges and this was significantly correlated with particular features on the verge. Bank Vole and Field Vole numbers showed a significant positive correlation with the dimensions of hedges and the width of the tall grass area, respectively. Wood Mice were also more numerous on verges with big hedges but the relationship between mouse abundance and verge structure was complex. The number of mice in 1994 was positively and significantly correlated with hedge features and with the width of the short grass sightline, whereas, in autumn 1996, they were only significantly correlated with total verge width (positive association) and ditch width (negative association).},

journal = {Evolutionary Ecology},

number = {6},
pages = {559-574},
abstract = {Most life-history theory assumes that short-term variation in an organism's environment does not affect the survivorships and fecundities of the organisms. This assumption is rarely met. Here we investigate the population and evolutionary biology of red deer, Cervus elephas, to see if relaxation of this assumption is likely to make significant differences to the predicted evolutionary biology of this species. To do this we used 21 years of data from a population of deer on Rum, Western Isles, Scotland. Population growth rates in a stochastic environment were estimated using Tuljapurkar's small noise approximation, confirmed by bootstrap simulation. Numerical differentiation was used to see if the selection pressures (i.e, sensitivities of population growth rate to changes in the vital rates) differ between the stochastic and deterministic cases. The data also allow the costs of reproduction to be estimated. These costs, incorporated as trade-offs into the sensitivity analysis, allow investigation of evolutionary benefits of different life-history tactics. Environmentally induced stochastic variation in the red deer vital rates causes a slight reduction (similar or equal to 1%) in the predicted population growth rate and has little impact on the estimated selection pressures on the deer's life-history. We thus conclude that, even though density-independent stochastic effects on the population are marked, the deer's fitness is not markedly affected by these and they are adapted to the average conditions they experience. However, the selected life-history is sensitive to the trade-offs between current fecundity, survivorship and future fecundity and it is likely that the environmental variance will affect these trade-offs and, thus, affect the life-history favoured by selection. We also show that the current average life-history is non-optimal and suggest this is a result of selection pressures exerted by culling and predation, now much reduced. As the use of stochastic or deterministic methods provide similar estimates in this case, the use of the latter is justified. Thus, r (the annual per capita rate of population growth) is an appropriate measure of fitness in a population with stochastic numerical fluctuations. In a population of constant size lifetime reproductive success is the obvious measure of fitness to use.},

We then outline a methodology which overcomes some of the practical difficulties associated with the detailed observation of rats in a natural enviroment, and present preliminary data on their feeding patterns in a 270 m2 outdoor enclosure. These data illustrate that feeding patterns are influenced by 1) social status 2) reproductive behaviour and 3) predator's odours. Each of these effects emphasizes the importance of seeking interpretations of rat behaviours under natural conditions.},

abstract = {Brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) are notoriously difficult to poison. As well as being of practical relevance, the combination of behavioural and physiological traits which underlie this ability are of particular interest to the student of behavioural ecology, and ecological genetics. The rats' capability to detect and avoid poisonous substances have prompted the development of more sophisticated poisons such as the anticoagulant warfarin which circumvents the rats behavioural lines of defence. The subsequent evolution of physiological resistance to warfarin constitutes one of the best examples of natural selection in operation. Despite its obvious selective advantage however, warfarin resistance can be costly : resistant individuals can show a deficient vitamin K metabolism, lower growth rates and reduced viability. This results in a lower fitness of resistant genotypes in a warfarin-free environment and may impair the spread of resistance. Recent studies, however, indicate a possible further development in the arms race between humans and rats : the existence of a novel form of resistance which incurs little cost, and which may confer a selective advantage even in the absence of poison.},

journal = {Behaviour},
volume = {132},
pages = {193-212},
abstract = {One way of understanding the evolution of social dominance is to establish which factors determine an animal's ability to dominate conspecifics. The dynamics of dominance between 20 adult male wild rats were investigated in a multi-generational, free-breeding colony in a large outdoor enclosure. Dominance relations between the adult males were stable and organised in a near-linear hierarchy. Dyadic interactions not fitting the social hierarchy, as well as challenges by subordinates and overt aggression by dominants were rare (< 5%) and principally occurred between animals of similar social rank. The correlates of social status within the colony show, for the first time in adult small mammals, that despite the significant role of body weight on the probability of winning contests, age was the most reliable indicator of adult dominance, with the higher ranking males being older but not necessarily heavier. Age also explained the outcome of 85% of agonistic encounters between dyads, compared with 65% for weights. The proximate mechanisms of age-related dominance fit better the 'previous outcome' hypothesis than the alternative 'fighting skill' or 'site dominance' hypotheses. The stability of dominance relations and the role of age, which in stable groups is equivalent with time spent in the colony, suggest that rats remain dominant over individuals that they have beaten in the past, long after initial body weight asymmetries have disappeared. The functional significance of the acceptance of subordinate social status is consistent with the fact that dominant individuals generally could not monopolize food resources or mates.},

volume = {6},

pages = {335-346},
abstract = {Researchers often use harp traps and mist nets to capture bats, and need to be aware of factors that affect trap capture efficiency. Ultrasound reflects from small targets in a frequency-dependent manner, so we predicted that higher frequency sound pulses Would return stronger echoes from the fine wires and net of bat traps than would lower frequency signals. We also predicted that mist nets would return stronger echoes than harp traps because mist nets are made of a higher density (and often diameter) of material. Ensonification experiments with pulses of 20-110 kHz showed that both harp traps and mist nets reflected higher frequency pulses more strongly. Pocketed areas of mist nets returned stronger echoes than harp traps although at some frequencies differences between trap types were small. Our results provide one verified reason why harp traps are more effective than mist nets at capturing bats, and also predict that bats using high frequency echolocation calls may be more difficult to trap than species emitting low frequency signals. Interspecies differences in how traps are detected are therefore likely sources of bias in field surveys. Observations of bats encountering harp traps in the field showed less than 4% of encounters resulted in capture, and only 8.8% of encounters could be interpreted its a failure to detect the trap. A comparison between two species that differ in echolocation call and flight characteristics (Rhinolophus hipposideros and Myotis nattereri) showed no difference in trap detection or avoidance. However, differences in behaviour during trap encounters were apparent.},

abstract = {1. It is well known that roads can have a significant impact, usually negative, on species and ecosystems. However, despite their protected status in many countries, little research has been done into the effects of roads on bats. With a view to making more informed management recommendations, we address the simple question: are bat activity and diversity (as measured with ultrasonic detectors) correlated with distance from a major road? 2. Broadband acoustic surveys were conducted on 20 walked transects perpendicular to the M6, a major road inCumbria (UK), with bat activity recorded at eight spot checks per transect at different distances from the road. Climatic and habitat variables were also recorded, and the relationships between bat activity and these variables were investigated using generalised estimated equations (GEE) and ordinal logistic regression. 3. Total bat activity, the number of species and the activity of Pipistrellus pipistrellus (the most abundant species) were all positively correlated with distance from the road. Total activity increased more than threefold between 0 and 1600 m from the road. These effects were found to be consistent over 2 years. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study is one of the first to show that roads have a major negative impact on bat foraging activity and diversity and is broadly applicable to insectivorous bat communities worldwide. Mitigation requires that roads are made more permeable to bats through the use of effective crossings, such as underpasses and overpasses, and that habitat is improved within 1 km of major roads. Because the effectiveness of current mitigation measures is unknown, well- designed monitoring of mitigation is essential.},

abstract = {The introduction of the American eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in Europe is causing a dramatic decline of the native European red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris), due to competition. We used spatially explicit population dynamics models to illustrate the potential expansion of the grey squirrel from Italy, the only continental country with the species, into neighbouring countries. Simulations started with the known grey squirrel distributions in 1996 and modelled the spread for the next 100 years in two different scenarios. One "best case" in which a random seed crop pattern of poor, good and mast seed crops was simulated with concomitant effects on squirrel fecundity and mortality and one "worst case" scenario in which poor years were not included. In the best case scenario, it will take 30-40 years for grey squirrels to start invading the Alps and about 70-75 years to cross the border between Italy and France. First populations in Switzerland are predicted in 2051-2066. In the worst case scenario, the spread will be significantly faster: the species is predicted to reach France in 2026-2031 and Switzerland in 2031-2041. Removing two of the three populations of grey squirrel will likely postpone the invasion of Switzerland but not of France. Large areas of Europe contain potentially good habitat for grey squirrels, and expansion from Italy, to France, Switzerland and belong to most of Eurasia is simply a matter of time. This will represent a serious risk for the conservation of the native red squirrel and will have implications for national forest operations. However, a European policy towards introduced species is still lacking. There is therefore a need for a co-ordinated European approach to the management of the grey squirrel and other introduced species. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We demonstrate changes over time in the spatial and temporal dynamics of an herbivorous small rodent by analyzing time series of population densities obtained at 21 locations on clear cuts within a coniferous forest in Britain from 1984 to 2004. Changes had taken place in the amplitude, periodicity, and synchrony of cycles and density-dependent feedback on population growth rates. Evidence for the presence of a unidirectional traveling wave in rodent abundance was strong near the beginning of the study but had disappeared near the end. This study provides empirical support for the hypothesis that the temporal (such as delayed density dependence structure) and spatial (such as traveling waves) dynamics of cyclic populations are closely linked. The changes in dynamics were markedly season specific, and changes in overwintering dynamics were most pronounced. Climatic changes, resulting in a less seasonal environment with shorter winters near the end of the study, are likely to have caused the changes in vole dynamics. Similar changes in rodent dynamics and the climate as reported from Fennoscandia indicate the involvement of large-scale climatic variables.},

journal = {Animal Welfare},
volume = {7},
number = {4},
pages = {427-443},
abstract = {This study (1978-93) was concerned with calf site selection by red deer from three contrasting areas (two deer parks and one deer farm) of north-west England. It arose from initial (1960s-70s) concern over poor recruitment and the high incidence of 'abandoned' calves (at one site), and increasing levels of public disturbance in Lyme Park and Tatton Park. A better understanding of calving behaviour could lead to improved management procedures during calving. Habitat selection by adult females was examined indirectly, by recording where calves (0-2 days old) were born in relation to their weight. The deer farm provided a control site, where the effects of their social traditions could be minimized. Calves were born over a wide area of moorland in Lyme Park but confined to a deer sanctuary in Tatton Park. Areas of obvious plant cover were selected in preference to open ground in Tatton Park and in the deer farm. No marked preferences were apparent in Lyme Park, although some areas were used more frequently than others, over all years. Most calves occurred within female home ranges. In Tatton Park, the heaviest calves were found in the preferred calving sites. Calf weights varied widely within and between study sites. On average, the smallest (lightest) calves were recorded in Lyme Park and the heaviest in the deer farm. Sex differences in calf weights occurred in Tatton Park, but not at the other two sites. In general, late-born calves were smaller than those born early in the season. Variations in birthweight were linked to differences in female growth and site conditions. In the absence of more detailed statistics, calf weights can provide a useful measure of population performance. Collectively, these results suggest that red deer can adopt a range of calving behaviours ('tactics') depending on the nature of the habitat (presence or absence of cover), perceived predation 'risks' (levels of disturbance), established social traditions and, possibly, parental investment. Cover appeared to be a primary requirement for calving. In the absence of cover, other behaviours were adopted. In some cases, these behaviours were not in the best interests of the calf as parent females rarely returned to feed their calves during the day and often engaged in energetically costly diversionary activities. In deer farms, conflicts between hinds may be exaggerated by limited access to ground cover, similar social status and low variance in calf weights. In view of these findings, there is a need to devise new ways of attracting captive deer to cover, perhaps by modifications to the habitat mosaic. Observations from Tatton Park show that deer readily use refuges (the sanctuary), when available, although it may be difficult to initiate new behaviours where long-established traditions occur (eg Lyme Park). Mortality amongst calves is unacceptable in deer parks, but further work under move controlled conditions, is required to establish the mechanisms of calf site selection. Effective methods of locating calves are desirable for management purposes.},

abstract = {Estimating density, age and sex structure of wild populations is a key objective in wildlife management. Live trapping is frequently used to collect data on populations of small and medium-sized mammals. Ideally, sampling mammal populations by live capturing of individuals provides a random and representative sample of the target population. Trapping data may, however, be biased. We used live-capture data from mountain hares Lepus timidus in Scotland to assess sampling bias between two different capture methods. We captured hares using baited cage traps and long nets on five study areas in the Scottish Highlands. After controlling for the effects of body size, individuals caught in traps were lighter than individuals caught using long nets, suggesting that the body condition of hares differed between the capture methods. This tendency may reflect an increased risk-taking of individuals in poorer body condition and less aversion to entering traps in order to benefit from eating bait. Overall, we caught more adult hares than juveniles and more female hares than males. Our results show that estimates of density and population structure of mountain hares using live-capture data could be affected by the capture method used. We suggest that live-capture studies employ more than one capture method and test for heterogeneity in capture probability to minimise potential bias and achieve reliable estimates of population parameters.},

We consider a realistic alternative hypothesis which allows the key assertion by Doncaster and Woodroffe to be directly tested. We show that a Dirichlet tessellation model that does nor give a major role to the main setts fits data from several studies - two of those considered by Doncaster and Woodroffe, and a more recent and extensive one - significantly better than Doncaster and Woodroffe's model. For the majority of territories, especially in the most extensive data set, differences in territory shape and size under the two models are substantial, suggesting that a different biological mechanism is at work, as well as or instead of dependence on main sett locations.},

The investigation showed that within any 1 year over the 34 years of the investigation the percentage of rabbits with myxomatosis varied between 0 and 24 %, while for E. stiedae infections fluctuated between 3 and 42 %. There were strong seasonal trends in the prevalence of myxomatosis with over 16 % being infected in September and October, and for E. stiedae, peaks of over 40 % of livers infected were recorded in July. From 2007 to 2010, faeces were also examined for coccidia oocysts and parasitic nematode eggs. Rabbits infected with the myxoma virus had mean oocyst counts of 73,665 per gram faeces, while rabbits not infected with the myxoma virus had counts of 31,952 oocysts per gram. Comparable figures for nematode faecal egg counts were 911 per gram in myxomatosis-infected animals and 427 per gram in uninfected animals. The elevated nematode faecal egg counts in rabbits with myxomatosis reflects increased worm burdens already reported, but the elevated counts of coccidial oocysts have not previously been reported. This would suggest that myxomatosis could compromise rabbit immunity to nematodes and coccidia.},

Across the study site, badger latrines and setts were found in prominent clusters, at distances of up to 250 and 200 m respectively. This was partly due to small-scale clustering of latrines around sett sites, so that disease risk may be higher within the vicinity of setts. The clustered distribution suggests that sites of high risk for TB transmission may be localised within farms. Exclusion of cattle from the few sett and latrine sites within their grazing pasture is therefore likely to provide an effective way of reducing the risk of disease transmission. We also found evidence of social sub-division within badger social groups based on differences in the use of main and outlier setts. This may contribute to localised clusters of infection within the badger population, resulting in heterogeneous patterns of environmental disease risk to the wider host community. A greater understanding of variation in host behaviour and its implications for patterns of disease will allow the development of more targeted and effective management strategies for wildlife disease in group-living hosts.},

abstract = {1. Direct interactions between individuals play an important part in the sociality of group-living animals, their mating system and disease transmission. Here, we devise a methodology to quantify relative rates of proximity interaction from radio-tracking data and highlight potential asymmetries within the contact network of a moderate-density badger population in the north-east of England. 2. We analysed radio-tracking data from four contiguous social groups, collected over a 3-year period. Dynamic interaction analysis of badger dyads was used to assess the movement of individuals in relation to the movement of others, both within and between social groups. Dyads were assessed with regard to season, sex, age and sett use pattern of the badgers involved. 3. Intragroup separation distances were significantly shorter than intergroup separation distances, and interactions between groups were rare. Within groups, individuals interacted with each other more often than expected, and interaction patterns varied significantly with season and sett use pattern. Non-mover dyads (using the main sett for day-resting on > 50% of occasions) interacted more frequently than mover dyads (using an outlier sett for day-resting on > 50% of occasions) or mover-non-mover dyads. Interactions between group members occurred most frequently in winter. 4. Of close intragroup interactions (< 50 m separation distance), 88.6% were associated with a main sett and only 4.4% with outlier setts. Non-mover dyads and non-mover-mover dyads interacted significantly more often at the main sett than mover-only dyads. These results highlight the importance of the main sett to badger sociality and support the suggestion that badger social groups are comprised of different subgroups, in our case based on differential sett use patterns. 5.Asymmetries in contact structure within a population will affect the way in which diseases are transmitted through a social network. Assessment of these networks is essential for understanding the persistence and spread of disease within populations which do not mix freely or which exhibit heterogeneities in their spatial or social behaviour.},

abstract = {Interspecific competition is one of several constraints that might prevent an individual from maximising its energy intake. When an interspecific competitor is introduced, an individual is often forced to shift its diet according to the intensity of the competitive pressure. In this paper, we explore whether the introduced American mink (Mustela vison Schreber) shifts its diet when the density of its potential competitor, the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra L.), is increased. We compared the diets of otter and mink at the same location but at two moments in time when the relative densities of these two species were different while controlling for the abundance of aquatic prey. Mink and otters are semi-aquatic mammals belonging to the same guild of mustelids and otters are expected to be the dominant competitor because they are larger and better at hunting underwater. The diets of otters and mink overlap to a great extent but while otters specialise mainly on aquatic prey, mink are able to exploit both aquatic and terrestrial prey. These observations prompted the hypothesis investigated in this work that at higher otter densities the diet of mink should change to include a higher proportion of terrestrial items. This hypothesis was supported by the data and at higher otter densities mink diet was observed to consist of a higher proportion of mammals and birds while fewer fish were present, although this pattern was present only in winter while no changes were observed in spring. Meanwhile the diet of otters remained basically unchanged. In the second part of the study, we investigated whether niche breadth and niche overlap between otter and mink changed at different otter densities. We found that niche overlap declined as the density of otters increased, in agreement with the prediction of habitat selection theory.},

abstract = {Patterns of habitat selection by American mink Mustela vison within foraging areas located on the shore, were studied in a coastal environment of Scotland from November to March in 1983/84, 1984/85 and 1994/95. The abundance of prey in the intertidal zone was modelled in relation to abiotic environmental characteristics. Four factors were found to be important predictors of prey abundance: the position within the tidal zone, the abundance and size of rockpools, the nature of the substratum and the presence of fresh water streams. The model was used to predict prey abundance in different areas of the shore. We then investigated whether mink were choosing areas with higher prey abundance at different tidal levels and within, as opposed to between, core areas (areas with a relatively high density of fixes, encompassing usually one or more dens). Only when foraging at low or mid-tide and within core areas were mink found to behave selectively. They showed no significant preference for areas rich in prey when foraging at high tide and between core areas. Mink were also found to avoid areas with fresh water streams and to prefer foraging in the mid-tide zone. The findings are discussed in relation to prey abundance and competition with the otter Lutra lutra.},

abstract = {Given the difficulties in establishing population parameters of elusive animals in the wild by traditional methods, such as trapping, much attention has been given in recent years to non-invasive genetic sampling. Our work compared estimates of population size and sex ratio derived from genetic sampling with the known number and sex of animals released during an otter reintroduction and reports on the pitfalls and opportunities that may be encountered in studies of this kind. This study makes use of 121 samples of otter spraints (faeces) collected over 7 months during a reintroduction in the Upper Thames (UK) where a total of 17 otters was released in two consecutive phases. Spraints were processed with a multiple tubes approach and seven microsatellites were used. Of all collected samples, 19 % were complete for at least five loci, the minimum required for discrimination between individuals. Six out of nine of the otters that were released in the first phase were detected, four males and two females, while none of the otters released in the second phase was detected probably due to a combination of sampling pitfalls and otter behaviour. In particular, the specific sex (mostly females) and dominance composition (lower) of the individuals in the second release group may explain our failure to detect individuals in this group. Taken together, our results add further evidence that genetic sampling approaches represent a potentially accurate and non-invasive route to census populations of otters but that the sampling design should take into account factors like the sex ratio and dominance composition of the population in order to maximise detection and minimise error.},

abstract = {Optimal foraging and habitat selection theories predict that heterogeneous environments should favour the coexistence of competitors, especially when the dominant competitor is a specialist and the sub-ordinate is a generalist. In this paper, we analysed differential habitat use as a potential mechanism for the coexistence of two competing riparian mammals, the specialist and dominant Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and the generalist and sub-ordinate American mink (Mustela vison). We tested three hypotheses: H1: mink coexist with otters for longer in areas with abundance of habitats hosting terrestrial prey because, by not relying on aquatic prey, mink can segregate from its competitor. H2: the characteristics of the habitat closer to the riverbank will affect the length of time the two species coexist, because mink are still tied to the water even in the presence of otters. H3: denser vegetative cover along the bank increases the duration of coexistence of mink and otters because it reduces the frequency of their encounters. The first hypothesis was supported by the data and we found that in areas where terrestrial prey was abundant mink coexisted for longer with otters. The second hypothesis was also supported by the data and the characteristics of the habitat closer to the riverbank were the most important in determining coexistence time. Finally, we did not find supporting evidence for the third hypothesis. This study provides strong evidence that habitat heterogeneity plays an important role in determining the likelihood of coexistence of American mink with Eurasian otters. This result is particularly important from a conservation standpoint. Mink are invasive and a threat to endangered species in parts of their range. The knowledge that mink have a higher chance to persist in the presence of otters when terrestrial prey is abundant should be used to target areas for preferential mink management.},

abstract = {Competition is considered to be a major evolutionary driving force within assemblages of related and morphologically similar species, but it is notoriously difficult to test and quantify especially amongst species that cannot be easily manipulated in a laboratory or in the field. By exploiting a re-introduction of Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) in the Upper Thames catchment (UK) in 1999 we performed an experiment to test whether there was evidence of competition between otters and American mink (Mustela vison). Mink and otters are semi-aquatic mustelids belonging to the same guild. Otters are expected to be the dominant competitor because they are larger and better adapted at exploiting aquatic resources. Our hypothesis was that mink declines when the density of otters increases. We measured the effect of competition at the population level, by observing whether mink distribution and densities changed in an area of 1353 km(2) in association with the arrival of its putative competitor. We estimated distribution and densities by means of sign surveys and trapping. The results showed that otters were associated with a significant and rapid reduction in the densities of mink, while mink occupancy remained approximately the same in an area of 2464 km(2) that was used as a control. We observed that the spatial distribution of the mink population throughout its decline was influenced by the yearly cycle of mink activities, with areas being temporarily re-colonized during the dispersal season. Mink is an invasive species in the UK threatening the survival of some native species. Our findings suggest that the re-establishment of otter populations is likely to lead to a decline of mink that may, in turn, be beneficial to native species threatened by this invasive.},

abstract = {American mink Mustela vison are an invasive species in many parts of the world (e.g. Europe, Iceland and South America) and in many of these areas they are a threat to the native wildlife. It is therefore important to establish a reliable and efficient method to estimate their relative abundance in order to manage their populations. In this study, the use of surveys of signs (scats and footprints) as a way to estimate the relative abundance of American mink was evaluated. Populations of mink in three areas of England were studied to evaluate the impact of three factors (surveyor, marking places and month) on the probability of deposition and detection of signs. Among these factors only month had a significant effect. In the second part of the study, sign surveys were compared with live trapping and it was found that the proportion of sections with mink signs was only loosely correlated to the abundance of mink as estimated from live trapping. In conclusion, this study suggests that, provided that surveyors are trained, that there is a sufficient number of marking places in each section, and that the surveys are carried out in comparable seasons, sign surveys are an appropriate way to monitor the relative abundance of mink. Sign surveys are better than trapping when it is necessary to monitor mink populations over large areas because they are less time consuming, require less manpower and are cheaper.},

abstract = {Understanding the causes that determine the spread and subsequent population trends of invasive species is important as it can help predict and manage their impact, as well as advance the theory of invasion. The American mink Mustela vison is a riparian mustelid and an invasive species in several countries. Mink have been introduced to England in the early decades of the last century and have been expanding their range until the mid-eighties. Since then, however, the number of sites occupied by mink has been declining. We investigated three possible causes of such a decline: (1) A downtrend of the fur farming industry; (2) An increase of European polecats Mustela putorius; (3) An increase of Eurasian otters Lutra lutra. Mink trends were derived from data collected by the National Otter Survey, a large-scale long-term survey of the whole of England from 1977 to 2002. We discuss how the observed decline in the number of sites occupied by mink may be due to a combination of an actual decrease in the distribution and density of mink and to a change in the focus of mink activities away from water, rather than to a change in their marking behaviour. Taken together, our results suggest that the decline of mink is related to an increase in the native otter population through interspecific competition, although at a local level also other factors may be important. As the otter population is still increasing, it is likely that the number of sites occupied by mink will continue to decline, a process that may be beneficial to aquatic and semi-aquatic species suffering from mink predation.

abstract = {Urbanisation is widely considered to promote the establishment of non-native species, but there is limited empirical evidence of the ecological factors driving their responses. The grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis (Gmelin 1788) is native to North America, but is widespread in the UK and is starting to spread across Europe. It is regarded as one of the world's worst invasive animals due to its adverse impacts on native biodiversity. We use the non-native grey squirrel population in Sheffield (UK) as a case study to assess which factors limit its distribution and abundance in urban environments. In 2010 the city-wide population of adult squirrels peaked at an estimated 6539 in autumn (0.46 squirrels/ha), with maximum local densities of 8.29/ha. These densities appear to be slightly lower than those recorded in urban environments in the species' native range. Grey squirrels occurred more frequently at urban sites with larger amounts of green-space in the surrounding region. Local habitat characteristics were, however, more powerful predictors of urban grey squirrel occurrence and abundance than regional availability of green space. Canopy cover, seed bearing trees and supplementary feeders, provided for garden birds, positively influenced grey squirrels. The potential for grey squirrels to connect city dwellers with nature thus appears to be highest in urban locations that have considerable capacity to support native biodiversity. The beneficial impacts of supplementary feeding on grey squirrel populations is notable given concerns that squirrels can adversely influence bird populations. These habitat associations also imply that grey squirrels typically respond negatively to urbanisation, which challenges arguments that urbanisation favours exotic species.},

abstract = {Supplementary feeding of birds, particularly in urban areas, is often associated with increased population size and fecundity. In the UK, the non-native Grey Squirrel Sciurus carolinensis is common in rural and urban habitats. It exploits supplementary feeders and may induce interference competition by excluding birds, but empirical evidence of this is unavailable. Using controlled model presentation experiments, we demonstrate that Grey Squirrels could reduce bird use of supplementary feeders and induce interference competition. Total bird resource use was reduced by 98% and most species exhibited similar sensitivities. The likelihood and magnitude of interference competition will depend on how rapidly displaced birds find alternative food sources; it will be greatest where there are high Grey Squirrel densities and few supplementary feeders. Other studies suggest that supplementary feeding increases Grey Squirrel numbers, and the species is also predicted to expand its non-native range across most of Europe. Our data indicate that Grey Squirrels may eventually alter the net effect of supplementary feeding on bird populations across the European continent; increased use of squirrel-proof feeders may help to minimize such effects.},

In this study, radio-transmitters weighing < 0.35 g were built. These increased the body mass of the animals from 4.5% to 8.1%, with no demonstrable adverse effect on their flight behaviour. The habitat selection of eight female lesser horseshoe bats was studied in Monmouthshire, U.K. The bats had foraging ranges between 12 and 53 ha (100% kernel). Although one bat foraged 4.2 km from the roost, for 50% of the time tracked bats were recorded within 600 m of the nursery roost. The estimated density within 200 m of the roost was 5.8 foraging bats/ha. This decreased to 0.01 bats/ha at 1200 m. Compositional analysis revealed that this species used woodlands, predominately broadleaf, more than any other habitat. In addition, the bats foraged in areas of high habitat diversity. Conservation management of this species should concentrate on such areas within 2.5 km of the nursery roost.},

abstract = {Daubenton's bat, a trawling vespertilionid bat species, hunts for insects that fly close to, or rest on, the water surface. During summer, many ponds at which Daubenton's bats hunt become gradually covered with duckweed. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of duckweed cover on the hunting behaviour of Daubenton's bats and on the ultrasound-reflecting properties of the water surface. Our study revealed the following. (1) Daubenton's bat avoids water surfaces covered with duckweed. (2) Prey abundance was related to the number of foraging Daubenton's bats but was independent of duckweed cover. (3) When mealworms were presented among standardized amounts of duckweed to naturally foraging Daubenton's bats, they caught significantly less mealworms when the duckweed cover was increased. (4) Measurements with ultrasonic signals show that a water surface covered with duckweed returns a much stronger background echo at small angles (i.e. parallel to the water surface) compared to an uncovered water surface. It seems likely that a cover of duckweed on the water surface interferes with prey detection by masking the echoes returning from prey. (5) It was relatively difficult for the bats to discriminate small patches of duckweed from mealworms. The proposed discrimination mechanism for this trawling bat species suggests that single duckweed patches can also be mistaken for natural prey by Daubenton's bats.},

abstract = {Although forest fragmentation can greatly affect biodiversity, responses to landscape-scale measures of woodland configuration in Europe have been examined for only a limited range of taxa. Almost all European bat species utilise woodland, however little is known about how they are affected by the spatial arrangement of woodland patches. Here we quantify landscape structure surrounding 1129 roosts of six bat species and a corresponding number of control locations across the UK, to examine associations between roost location and landscape composition, woodland proximity and the size of the nearest broadleaved woodland patch. Analyses are performed at two spatial scales: within 1 km of the roost and within a radius equivalent to the colony home-range (3-7 km). For four species, models at the 1 km scale were better able to predict roost occurrence than those at the home-range scale, although this difference was only significant for Pipistrellus pipistrellus. For all species roost location was positively associated with either the extent or proximity of broadleaved woodland, with the greatest effect of increasing woodland extent seen between 0% and 20% woodland cover. P. pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Rhinolophus hipposideros, Eptesicus serotinus and Myotis nattereri all selected roosts closer to broadleaved woodland than expected by chance, with 90% of roosts located within 440 m of broadleaved woodland. Roost location was not affected by the size of the nearest broadleaved patch (patches ranged from 0.06-2798 ha +/- 126 SD). These findings suggest that the bat species assessed here will benefit from the creation of an extensive network of woodland patches, including small patches, in landscapes with little existing woodland cover.

journal = {Biological Conservation},
volume = {144},
number = {6},
pages = {1790-1798},
abstract = {Within agricultural landscapes, linear features such as hedgerows and tree-lines provide valuable habitat for many species. We use data from 315 transects, completed as part of a national acoustic survey of bat distribution, to examine the incidence of four bat species adjacent to linear features in rural areas. The use of linear features was assessed in relation to hedgerow width, tree density, the presence of water and woodland proximity. To examine the effect of tree density, linear features were classified as either hedgerows without trees, hedgerows with sparse trees (comprising <50% tree canopy) or tree-lines (>50% tree canopy). The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pipstrellus was not affected by tree density; linear features of all types were associated with a similar increase in P. pipistrellus incidence. The use of linear features by Pipistrellus pygmaeus was dependent on both tree density and the proximity of woodland; only linear features containing trees provided an increase in P. pygmaeus incidence regardless of woodland proximity. P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus incidence was not affected by hedgerow width or the presence of water. Incidence of Nyctalus noctula and Eptesicus serotinus was unaffected by the density of linear features of any type. Many agri-environment schemes offer financial incentives for the creation and management of hedgerows. Optimising the biodiversity gain provided by linear features will maximise the effectiveness of these schemes. Agri-environment measures that encourage the provision and retention of hedgerow trees will benefit bats in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, we use an ancient DNA dataset to test more directly postglacial histories of the water vole (Arvicola amphibius, formerly A. terrestris), a species that is both a conservation priority and a pest in different parts of its range. We specifically examine colonization of Britain, where a complex genetic structure can be observed today. Although we focus on population history at the limits of the species' range, the inclusion of additional European samples allows insights into European postglacial colonization events and provides a molecular perspective on water vole taxonomy.},

volume = {42},

pages = {118-128},
abstract = {1. Monitoring of exposure to pesticides in many countries shows extensive exposure of predators to anticoagulant rodenticides, which are used to control rats. Many predators and scavengers are declining in numbers, and exposure to rodenticides might therefore be of importance in conservation biology. 2. Predators and scavengers of poisoned rats are at most risk of secondary poisoning. However, several predatory species of conservation concern rarely eat rats, implicating non-target small mammals as the major route of exposure. For the first time, this research investigated the importance of non-target small mammals as routes of exposure to rodenticide for predators and scavengers in the UK. 3. Exposure studies of non-target small mammals were carried out alongside routine rat control at five sites, around agricultural buildings (n = 2) and feed hoppers for game birds (n = 3). 4. Three non-target rodent species fed on rodenticide from bait boxes during routine rat control treatments. A large proportion (48.6%) of individuals in local populations ate the bait: woodmice Apodemus sylvaticus were most exposed, followed by bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus then field voles Microtus agrestis. 5. Local populations of non-target small mammals declined significantly following rodenticidal rat control but their relative proportions did not change significantly. Populations recovered partially after 3 months, depending on the time of the year relative to the breeding cycle. 6. Synthesis and applications. Our results clearly demonstrate that routine rat control reduced local populations of non-target small mammals. This may limit the food supply of some specialist predators. Most importantly, this demonstrates a significant route of exposure of predators and scavengers of small mammals to secondary poisoning. Rodenticides are applied on farms and game estates across the UK. Hence the results of this study are indicative of non-target rodenticide exposure nationally. Mitigation requires a shift from the current reliance on rodenticides to ecologically based rodent management, involving improvements in site management and the adoption of good farming practice.},

journal = {Animal Behaviour},
volume = {82},

pages = {353-358},
abstract = {Mate choice in mammals is often influenced by the presence or absence of familiarity with the potential mates. While females of many social species prefer to mate with unfamiliar males, many solitary female rodents exhibit a preference for familiar males. The harvest mouse is such a solitary species, with no intersexual size dimorphism, and in which the females are possibly dominant to the males. This leaves the females' choice of mate relatively unhindered by direct male coercion or male-male competition. To isolate the role of familiarity in female preference in the harvest mouse, we conducted a two-stage controlled choice experiment, in which the female had a choice between the scent of two males, one familiar and one unfamiliar to her, and, in the second stage, two tethered males. When only olfactory cues were available to the females, no preferences were observed. The results of the live test, however, showed that female harvest mice preferred familiar males over unfamiliar ones when they were in oestrus. Furthermore, females spent more time in proximity to unfamiliar males when they were not in oestrus; and the difference in the weights of the males affected the strength of the female's response, which was opposite for oestrous and dioestrous females. These results support the hypothesis that female harvest mice prefer mating with a familiar male, point to an interaction between familiarity and male size in female preference and highlight the importance of the female's reproductive state during mate preference tests.

Due to logistics of robust behavioural evaluation in situ, the majority of studies on wild animals involve taking animals into captivity for testing, potentially compromising results. Three in situ tests for evaluation of boldness in San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) were developed (ENOT: extended novel object test; RNOT: rapid novel object test; TH: trap/handling test). Each test successfully identified variation in boldness within its target age class(es). The TH test was suitable for use across all age classes. Tests were assessed for in situ suitability and for quantity/quality of data yielded. ENOT was rated as requiring high levels of time, cost and labour with greater likelihood of failure. However, it was rated highly for data quantity/quality. The TH test was rated as requiring little time, labour and cost, but yielding lower quality data. RNOT was rated in the middle. Each test had merit and could be adapted to suit project or species constraints. We recommend field-based evaluation of personality, reducing removal of animals from the wild and facilitating routine incorporation of personality assessment into conservation projects.},

I have considered the original 40 farms as 63 units because many of the sites have been sub-divided into a number of individual dwellings by the contractors. Of the 51 units that were resurveyed, 36 units had been developed. Only eight of these 36 units were being used by bats (Myotis nattereri, Plecotus auritus, Pipistrellus spp. and Eptesicus serotinus); fifteen units had no evidence of use by bats but there was access for bats to return in the future; and thirteen units had no bat use with no potential for bats to return. Fifteen of the 51 resurveyed units had not been developed; all were still being used by bats. The influence of barn conversions on each bat species is discussed.

abstract = {A questionnaire, data from a public participation survey, past records and nestbox counts were used to review Dormouse distribution and status in Wales. At the turn of the century Dormice were reported from all Welsh counties. In the three decades from 1940 they were known from only seven l-km squares; this rose to 26 squares in the 1970s after a Mammal Society survey. Dormice are currently (1990-93) known from 107 1-km squares, only 0.5% of Wales, and are clearly rare. They have recently been 'rediscovered' in North Wales and Glamorgan. However, despite an increase in recording effort, very few sites have been found in northern Wales, implying a decline in status, and relatively few in the west compared to the east. Large tracts of Dyfed and Powys, where there is some suitable habitat, seem to lack Dormice. More than half of known Dormouse sites are in the deciduous margins of conifer plantations (36%) or in oak Quercus spp. woods (22%), both likely to be poor-quality habitats. Population densities at three sites are within the range of those measured in England. Forty per cent of known sites had some protected status, but 53% of sites were considered threatened, due to clear felling during forestry operations or lack of coppice woodland management. Dormouse distribution in Wales, on the western edge of the species' distributional range, seems to be strongly restricted by habitat suitability and climate. Many populations are likely to be threatened by replanting of ancient woodland and subsequent management harmful to the Dormouse's needs. Only 11% of ancient woodlands in Wales are large (> 20 ha). Dormice may therefore often occur in small woods, where their survival is likely to depend critically on the maintenance of hedgerows between woods. A programme of practical conservation and research is proposed to safeguard Dormouse populations.},

abstract = {Linear habitat elements (corridors) may be important for species survival if they promote dispersal between fragments of suitable habitat, although there is little understanding of the behavioural basis for their use. I conducted experiments to determine how the movement of an arboreal habitat specialist species (the dormouse, Muscardinus avellanarius) was affected by gaps in corridors (hedgerows) and the presence of food resources. Movement in noncorridor habitat were also assessed. Translocated dormice were clearly averse to crossing even narrow gaps in hedgerows and remained in hedgerows, rather than move into surrounding noncorridor habitat. Gaps are thus likely to constrain movement along habitat corridors. Dormice travelled further in a hedgerow lacking food resources, implying that lack of food may (within an animal's fasting endurance);actually promote movement. Although strongly arboreal, dormice were able to locomote rapidly through noncorridor habitat (a grass held). Noncorridor habitat thus does not represent a complete barrier to movements of at least 100 m. The results imply that appropriately managed hedgerows (without gaps) may play an important role as corridors in the dispersal of dormice between woodlands.

abstract = {What features of the mustelids might yield insight into issues of general importance for conservation and ecology? This review focuses attention on correlates of threat, intra-guild competition and reintroductions. Using the IUCN classification of the status of mustelid species, I constructed a statistical model of correlates of threat. This suggested that otters and martens, and mustelids with small distributional range sizes, were the most threatened. Whether or not a species was hunted and its habitat specificity did not correlate with threat. This analysis should be treated as indicative only, because the response variable (threat) was not totally independent of the explanatory variables. There is growing evidence that intraguild predation influences mustelids. In Scotland, there is some evidence for spatial segregation between Pine Martens and Red Foxes (a potential predator), Pine Marten relative abundance was higher in woodland interior than woodland edge. Red Foxes were equally abundant in woodland edge and interior. However. habitat fragmentation (woodland patch size) was the strongest correlate of relative abundance of both species. Research on mustelids has demonstrated the importance of appropriate release techniques during reintroductions. It has also shown that reintroductions of small numbers of animals can be successful, provided that they are conducted in high quality habitats, The implication is that habitat suitability assessments need to be given high priority. In this: respect, research in Britain suggests that inferring habitat needs from areas of relict distribution may lead to highly misleading conclusions.},

abstract = {It is estimated that one million wild animals are killed on UK roads each year and these casualties are potentially a valuable source of data relating to the size and distribution of populations. Road kill surveys have the potential to form the basis of a nationwide mammal monitoring scheme with multi-species coverage and excellent area sampling. However it has been argued that road casualty counts cannot be used to monitor population change because variation in the number of road deaths is related more to variation in traffic flow than to population density. We used rabbit and hedgehog as study species to examine if there was a relationship between traffic flow and road kill counts. We found no correlation between changes in traffic flow and road counts of hedgehog or rabbit. We conclude that a decrease in road kill counts of these species is highly likely to represent a decrease in absolute abundance and would therefore be a good index with which to monitor population decline.},

abstract = {1. A stratified sample of 238 woodlands in Herefordshire was surveyed to determine the incidence of dormice in relation to age, area and isolation of the site. Characteristically gnawed hazel-nut shells were sought as indicators of dormouse presence. 2. Dormice were more frequently found in ancient woodland than in recent woodland, supporting a previous hypothesis that they are an insular species. 3. Both site isolation and area influenced distribution, in accordance with insular ecological theory. Prevalence of woodland and boundaries around a site affected dormouse incidence. The results suggest that isolated woodlands less than about 20 ha in extent are unlikely to support viable dormouse populations. 4. Dormouse distribution was predicted for each woodland in Herefordshire, on the basis of woodland area and isolation. This included woodlands lacking hazel, where dormice would be difficult to detect by field survey. The data imply a possible metapopulation model. 5. Management policies should consider hedgerows and other arboreal links between a woodland and its neighbours, not just habitat within the site itself. Re-introductions and conservation management are most likely to be successful in larger, ancient woodland sites and most likely to be useful if these are close to, or linked with, adjacent woodland.},

abstract = {Dormouse abundance was studied at different woodland sites to identify significant determinants of habitat quality for this species and assess how these are affected by the coppice cycle. Findings are discussed in relation to managing woodlands where conservation of dormice is a desired priority. An unshaded understorey, with a high species diversity, was shown to provide the optimum habitat for dormice. Old coppice or understorey heavily shaded by taller trees supports fewer dormice and newly-cut coppice may take several years to regenerate into a state suitable for dormice. Bramble and honeysuckle are useful species, but are not essential. Coppice-with-standards management maintains a suitable habitat, but the taller trees should be widely spaced. Coppice should be cut in small dispersed patches, not in large adjacent blocks, and on a long cycle. The decline of such woodland management is probably a significant factor in the present scarcity of dormice, but reinstating coppice management may accelerate its extinction if inappropriately carried out. The needs of dormice may conflict with management intended to favour other taxa.},

Males travelled more widely than females. Male home ranges overlapped those of females but not each other.

Dormice choose flowers and fruits from a series of trees and shrubs as each becomes seasonally available. Deferred breeding and a high incidence of diurnal torpor suggest that dormice experience food shortage in spring. In early summer, when flowering has ended, but fruits are not yet ripe, dormice may again suffer food shortage. At this time they appear to supplement their diet by taking insects, another high-quality food with cyclic availability. Although some tree species are particularly valuable to dormice, they may not be essential if alternatives exist. A spectrum of species which will ensure a continuum of differing food supplies, within a small area, is essential. This implies a need for heterogeneous woodland structure.

journal = {Journal of Applied Ecology},
volume = {31},
number = {4},
pages = {699-708},
abstract = {1. We suggest that two important hypotheses underlie the translocation of animals for conservation management, namely that performance is higher for: (i) animals acclimated to a novel site before release (soft releases), compared with those not acclimated (hard releases); and (ii) wild-caught animals compared with captive-bred animals. Despite the increased use of translocations, these hypotheses remain largely untested. 2. Before reintroductions of the dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius, experimental translocations were conducted. These examined the performance of released dormice in relation to season, release methods and animal origin (captive-bred or wild-caught). 3. Early releases (May, June) lost body mass at a significantly higher rate than late releases (August, September). This resulted from seasonal food shortage and could be reversed by supplementary feeding. All released dormice appeared not to locate some important food resources. 4. Soft releases continued to nest at their release point and utilized supplementary food. Hard releases often dispersed and ignored food provided. These differences have profound consequences for reintroductions and hypotheses to explain them are proposed. 5. Wild-caught and captive-bred dormice responded differently to pre-release pens. After release, captive-bred animals travelled significantly less far, in total and from nests, each night. This would have reduced their chances of locating natural food sources and suggests that they are slower to establish in novel habitat. 6. The experiments support the hypotheses underlying translocations and imply that there may also be a common mechanism underlying the behaviour of translocated animals.},

abstract = {In the last 100 years, the Dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius has disappeared from about half its geographical range in Britain. Evidence is presented which indicates that declining range and numbers are due to a complex interplay of factors which include fragmentation, deterioration and loss of specialized habitat. The Dormouse is unusual in being a relatively k-selected small mammal, with exacting ecological requirements which render it very vulnerable, particularly to habitat fragmentation. The Dormouse is also sensitive to climate, both directly and probably indirectly through the effects of weather on the timing and abundance of food (insects, flowers and fruits). Combined with low population density and low intrinsic rate of population increase, this makes the Dormouse highly vulnerable, not just to absolute climatic measures (e.g. temperature, rainfall), but especially to climatic stochasticity, particularly at the edge of its range. There are strong associations between the distribution and changing status of the Dormouse and various climatic parameters, and clear parallels with other climate-sensitive taxa, notably bats and butterflies. The Dormouse is a very specialized species, highly sensitive to environmental change, resulting in its piecemeal, progressive extinction, particularly in northern counties. It is likely to be a very sensitive indicator species for monitoring future changing environments and an excellent model for studying the effects of habitat fragmentation, climatic shifts and climatic stochasticity.},

abstract = {Activity schedules of dormice were investigated in relation to weather and seasonal factors, by automatic monitoring of temperatures in nests of free-living animals. Data were obtained for two years and 294 dormouse-nights. The principal exogenous factor influencing pan-seasonal activity was photoperiod, activity beginning about 30 min after sunset and ending about 50 min before sunrise. However, on a seasonal scale, activity start time, end time and length were all strongly affected by ambient temperature and rainfall; higher temperatures appeared to lengthen activity, whereas rainfall reduced it. Diurnal activity was rare and took place when ambient air temperatures at midnight fell below 9 degrees C. There were large differences in activity schedules between years, which were also correlated with weather conditions. Dormice are thus directly affected by weather, which also strongly influences the availability of their food. Weather may in general heavily influence small hibernators, because they can utilise facultative torpor to overcome adverse conditions. Our results imply that weather may have a profound effect on dormouse life history, especially in Britain's maritime climate where summers are frequently cool and wet.},

abstract = {We suggest that reintroductions, like biological invasions, have two phases: establishment when a new population becomes self-sustaining, and spread when a population increases its distribution. Stochastic effects on mortality and sex ratios are most likely to determine whether a population becomes established, while factors influencing birth rates will probably most influence spread. Using this establishment-spread structure, we evaluate the autecological suitability of regions in England for pine marten Martes martes reintroductions. Risks of mortality from predator control, traffic accidents and predation by foxes were used to evaluate suitability for establishment. Mortality risk was higher in all potential release regions in England (selected as having 25% or more woodland cover) than in regions of current pine marten distribution in Scotland; risk of predation was higher in the latter. Indices of prey abundance were used to evaluate suitability for populations to spread. Prey indices in potential release regions were generally higher than in regions of current distribution. A relation between prey, woodland cover, and known pine marten densities suggested that potential release regions are capable of supporting relatively high densities of pine martens, though these might be reduced by higher mortality. We concluded that all potential release regions are suitable for pine marten populations to spread. However, reintroductions should first be to regions with lower risk of mortality, in case higher levels of the latter prevent establishment. The suitability of relict regions of distribution in northern England was low until post-war afforestation, suggesting that habitat suitability constrained recovery of relict populations. These regions remain less suitable for reintroductions.},

abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is a multi-species infection that commonly affects cattle and badgers in Great Britain. Despite years of study, the impact of badgers on BTB incidence in cattle is poorly understood. Using a two-host transmission model of BTB in cattle and badgers, we find that published data and parameter estimates are most consistent with a system at the threshold of control. The most consistent explanation for data obtained from cattle and badger populations includes within-host reproduction numbers close to 1 and between-host reproduction numbers of approximately 0.05. In terms of controlling infection in cattle, reducing cattle-to-cattle transmission is essential. In some regions, even large reductions in badger prevalence can have a modest impact on cattle infection and a multi-stranded approach is necessary that also targets badger-to-cattle transmission directly. The new perspective highlighted by this two-host approach provides insight into the control of BTB in Great Britain.},

abstract = {The eastern grey squirrel (hereafter 'grey squirrel') is considered one of the most damaging invasive alien species in Europe, with negative effects on native ecosystems. Despite it being widely perceived as a significant predator of bird eggs and chicks and as a competitor for nest sites, evaluation of the grey squirrel's impact on European bird populations has been hindered by limited empirical data. The aim was to review the incidence of grey squirrels as nest predators of and nest-site competitors with European birds, and to use this information to identify species at potential risk of negative effects from within the grey squirrel's expanding range in continental Europe. A comprehensive literature review was conducted, and the data were used alongside additional new data, to assess nest predation and competition by grey squirrels in their current European range. Bird species were grouped by nest-site type, which was used to predict the impact on similar species groups in regions of continental Europe predicted to be colonised by grey squirrels in the current century. Camera-monitoring and field evidence for 12 bird species and 12420 nests in Britain showed that grey squirrels rarely depredated eggs or chicks, affecting just 0.5% of nests. Nest-site competition was also minor, with grey squirrels occupying 0.8% of 122 small tree cavities and 14% of 57 larger cavities. At least 69 bird species in continental Europe could be exposed to potential nest predation or competition from expanding grey squirrel populations within the current century, but population-level effects currently appear to be unlikely. Current evidence shows that grey squirrels are unlikely to be significant predators of or competitors with nesting birds in their present or projected range in Europe. However, further studies of more species in different regions would be valuable, particularly in urban and suburban habitats.},

abstract = {The decline of farmland biodiversity over much of Europe has been largely attributed to agricultural intensification. Since the 1970s, governments have introduced agri-environment schemes (AES) aimed at mitigating this impact, but information on their success is limited. A five y, farm-scale experiment was conducted to test the efficacy of England's Environmental Stewardship AES in enhancing the species richness and abundance of small mammals (voles Cricetidae, mice Muridae, and shrews Soricidae) in an intensively-farmed arable landscape. Small mammal communities were sampled in spring and autumn on grassy field margins installed under the Entry Level Scheme (ELS) tier of Environmental Stewardship, where 1% of cropped land was converted to wildlife habitats. Results were compared with those from field margins on a second, experimental treatment (ELS Extra: ELSX) in which 5% of cropped land was taken out of production, and also field margins on a conventionally-farmed control treatment ('cross compliance': CC). Species richness and abundance of small mammals showed a significant increase on all treatments in spring and autumn. Many increases were greater on ELS and ELSX field margins compared to the CC controls, but there was little evidence that ELSX was more beneficial than ELS, and there were species-specific differences. Voles were not detected on any treatment in the initial sampling period but bank voles Myodes glareolus rapidly became abundant thereafter, particularly on ELS and ELSX field margins, and field voles Microtus agrestis also colonised. Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus were present on all treatments in all sampling periods, but spring abundance declined as vole abundance increased. These results suggest that the Entry Level Scheme tier of the English agri-environment scheme is effective in enhancing small mammal communities on arable farmland, with potential benefits for higher trophic levels via their predators.

abstract = {We studied the epidemiology of Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Nematoda) in the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) in an arable ecosystem, and investigated any association between infection and the movement patterns of male mice by manipulating worm burdens. Methods included the live-trapping of mice, estimation of worm burdens by faecal analysis, administration of either an anthelminthic or water (as a control) and the radio-tracking of selected animals. Heligmosomoides polygyrus showed an overdispersed distribution pattern, with prevalence tending to be higher in males and heavier mice. Prevalence and intensity peaked in spring and declined in autumn both in the entire population and in adults. This seasonality in the arable ecosystem in comparison to woodland may arise due to the direct and indirect impact of agricultural practice. To investigate the link between infection and movements, radio-tracked mice were classed as either 'Uninfected' or 'Infected'; mice were also classed as either 'Control' or 'Dosed'. There were no significant differences in movement parameters between 'Infected/Dosed' and 'Infected/ Control', possibly because treatment was not administered sufficiently frequently. Both 'Infected' classes of mice moved significantly faster than 'Uninfected' ones, and 'Infected/ Dosed' mice moved significantly further than 'Uninfected' ones. The percentage of time spent moving was also greater, and the home range area was larger, for 'Infected/Dosed' and 'Infected/ Control' than for 'Uninfected' mice. The observed differences in movement may have been the result of either the behaviour of mice influencing their parasite load or the parasite manipulating its host.},

abstract = {A social group of six badgers (Meles meles) (four adults and two cubs) was translocated from urban Bexhill, East Sussex, in August 1993 to a 1216m(2) electrified enclosure in apart of Suffolk largely unoccupied by badgers. Three adult badgers (SY2, SY5 and SY6) escaped from the release site prior to the removal of the perimeter fence on 10 December and established a sett near a village, 2.9km from the release site. In January 1994, the remaining adult (SY4) left the release site and moved 1.8km to the grounds of a youth detention centre. The cubs did not desert the site as readily as the adults. Home-range sizes for two adult females, SY4 and SY6, remained relatively constant, while that of adult male SY2 increased from 50ha in February to nearly 400ha in April. The range of SY2 overlapped parts of the ranges of the two females, although SY4 and SY6's ranges never overlapped. The percentage volume of scavenged food in the diet increased monthly between February and April which corresponded to increased garden activity over this period. Earthworms were the most important item in the diet. The establishment of both main setts near housing and the preference for foraging in gardens suggests that badgers released into novel environments may search for familiar habitats. It is concluded that translocation can successfully establish badgers at new locations. However, translocation as a solution to problems caused by badgers must only be viewed as a last resort, not least due to the potential for disease spread.},

abstract = {An understanding of the factors that affect the spread of endemic bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is critical for the development of measures to stop and reverse this spread. Analyses of spatial data need to account for the inherent spatial heterogeneity within the data, or else spatial autocorrelation can lead to an overestimate of the significance of variables. This study used three methods of analysis-least-squares linear regression with a spatial autocorrelation term, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and boosted regression tree (BRT) analysis-to identify the factors that influence the spread of endemic bTB at a local level in England and Wales. The linear regression and GWR methods demonstrated the importance of accounting for spatial differences in risk factors for bTB, and showed some consistency in the identification of certain factors related to flooding, disease history and the presence of multiple genotypes of bTB. This is the first attempt to explore the factors associated with the spread of endemic bTB in England and Wales using GWR. This technique improves on least-squares linear regression approaches by identifying regional differences in the factors associated with bTB spread. However, interpretation of these complex regional differences is difficult and the approach does not lend itself to predictive models which are likely to be of more value to policy makers. Methods such as BRT may be more suited to such a task. Here we have demonstrated that GWR and BRT can produce comparable outputs.},

abstract = {Culling badgers to control the transmission of bovine tuberculosis (TB) between this wildlife reservoir and cattle has been widely debated. Industry-led culling began in Somerset and Gloucestershire between August and November 2013 to reduce local badger populations. Industry-led culling is not designed to be a randomized and controlled trial of the impact of culling on cattle incidence. Nevertheless, it is important to monitor the effects of the culling and, taking the study limitations into account, perform a cautious evaluation of the impacts. A standardized method for selecting areas matched to culling areas in factors found to affect cattle TB risk has been developed to evaluate the impact of badger culling on cattle TB incidence. The association between cattle TB incidence and badger culling in the first 2 years has been assessed. Descriptive analyses without controlling for confounding showed no association between culling and TB incidence for Somerset, or for either of the buffer areas for the first 2 years since culling began. A weak association was observed in Gloucestershire for Year 1 only. Multivariable analysis adjusting for confounding factors showed that reductions in TB incidence were associated with culling in the first 2 years in both the Somerset and Gloucestershire intervention areas when compared to areas with no culling (incidence rate ratio (IRR): 0.79, 95% CI: 0.72-0.87, p < .001 and IRR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.34-0.51, p < .001, respectively). An increase in incidence was associated with culling in the 2-km buffer surrounding the Somerset intervention area (IRR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.09-1.75, p = .008), but not in Gloucestershire (IRR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.77-1.07, p = .243). As only 2 intervention areas with 2 years of data are available for analysis, and the biological cause-effect relationship behind the statistical associations is difficult to determine, it would be unwise to use these findings to develop generalizable inferences about the effectiveness of the policy at present.},

abstract = {1. Introduced species are, world-wide, one of the most serious threats to biodiversity. Grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis are one of many introduced species to have threatened a native congener; they are thought to have replaced red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris throughout much of the UK as a result of competition. The rate of competitive replacement may be influenced by habitat composition, with some red squirrel populations persisting for prolonged periods in the presence of greys in predominantly coniferous forest. 2. Here the similarity of red and grey squirrels' pattern of habitat use was investigated in Craigvinean forest in Scotland, UK, a site that has experienced apparent coexistence for up to 30 years. Overlap was examined in several dimensions: spatial overlap of home ranges, dynamic association and niche overlap. Habitat selection was examined at three levels: selection of core home range areas, selection of tree species within the home range, and the characteristics of patches used intensively by each squirrel species in comparison with random locations within their home range. 3. Although there was overlap between red and grey squirrel ranges, there were clear differences in the macrohabitats utilized, with red squirrels selecting areas of Norway spruce Picea abies and grey squirrels selecting riparian corridors of mixed woodland for their home ranges. Within their home ranges, habitat selection by individual red and grey squirrels was similar, but again with reds selecting Norway spruce and greys selecting patches of mixed conifers and broad-leaved trees. As no habitat variables consistently affected the microdistribution of red and grey squirrels within blocks or 'stands' of trees, stands that were used were thought to constitute good and relatively homogeneous habitats for squirrels of either species. 4. There was no evidence to suggest that red and grey squirrels avoided using the same areas at the same time, and potential niche overlap was considerable (0.77). However, partitioning of habitats may have reduced competition between red and grey squirrels and hence have contributed to red squirrel persistence at this site. 5. This work (i) reinforces earlier proposals that forest management offers a promising tool to assist the conservation of red squirrels; (ii) raises the issue of determining the spatial scale at which coexistence operates; and (iii) offers an illustration of how the management of invasive species can be mediated through the manipulation of niche availability.},

abstract = {Animals can modify their environment by consumptive and physical activities such as herbivory and soil disturbance. Engineering species may create structures that long outlive them and have lasting impacts on local communities of plants and animals. Water voles, Arvicola amphibious, are rodents that visibly impact riparian plant communities by grazing on surface and root vegetation and excavating long-lasting burrow systems. This species has a metapopulation structure and occurs across patches which are subject to frequent extinction and colonization events, causing spatially heterogeneous disturbances across the landscape. Using a chronosequence of water vole occupancy in the Highlands of Scotland, we show that heterogeneity in plant community composition and structure-both within and between colony patches-was related to cumulative measures of past physical impact: burrow density and time since a patch was last occupied by voles, rather than to current indices of vole occupancy. In our sample of 107 patches monitored over 5 years, no fewer than 31 unique patch occupancy histories were found, each with potentially subtle differences in the accumulated influence of water vole herbivory and engineering. As a result, a patchwork of different plant successional stages occurs across the riparian landscape which is both created and maintained by water vole extinction-colonization dynamics. We propose that the water vole-vegetation system can be described as a metacommunity where dispersal by a higher tropic agent at the landscape scale influences the spatial dynamics of plants at the patch level.},

pages = {118-130},
abstract = {1. The management of ungulate populations for sport in the presence of potentially conflicting interests such as conservation, either of the animals or of the habitat they use, may be formulated as a problem of optimization subject to constraints. 2. A deterministic simulation model was developed to assess optimal culling strategies for Scottish red deer. The aim was to allow deer population size to be reduced while maintaining a given annual cull of mature males (stags). 3. To achieve the above aim, the model indicated that the female (hind) cull should be restricted to non-lactating adult (yeld) and immature hinds. 4. If, instead, only calf and hind pairs are culled, the population size must be roughly 14% larger to achieve the same cull of mature stags. 5. Under ideal conditions, it seems possible to reduce hind numbers so that there are just two hinds of age greater than or equal to 1 for every stag of age greater than or equal to 6 in the population, provided that the population is maintained well below the maximum sustainable size (carrying capacity). Under this strategy, the model indicated that the ratio of stags of age greater than or equal to 1 to hinds of age greater than or equal to 1 should be between 1.5 and 1.8 to 1.0. 6. In principle, for populations well below carrying capacity, for every 10 mature stags to be stalked annually, it seems possible to reduce numbers such that the summer population comprises just 70 stags, 40 hinds and 20 calves. 7. In practice, limited culling of hind and calf pairs and young stags for quality control or other reasons, together with the need for a margin of safety, dictates that the hind population should be rather larger than this. However, on most estates in Scotland, hinds currently outnumber stags by roughly 2:1, so that our results suggest that large decreases in numbers of hinds can be achieved without incurring a loss of revenue from stalking. 8. If the market expectation were to be changed so that hunters wished to stalk stags regardless of age, rather than just those with perceived 'trophy' value as mature animals, the same number of deer could be stalked at an even lower population density, to the benefit of other land uses.},

abstract = {For European badgers Meles meles (Linnaeus, 1758), the importance of olfactory signals located at home-range borders in the context of territoriality has been widely accepted. Badgers, however, also scent mark far from their borders, often in the vicinity of their communal sett. Little is known about the significance of these marks in intra-specific communication. Here, we investigated the patterns of object-marking with subcaudal gland secretions close to the sett. Using remote-controlled, battery-powered infra-red video equipment, we recorded 442 incidences of object-marking between April 1996 and June 1997. The frequency of object marking varied significantly in relation to season, sex, age and reproductive status. In both sexes, relative object-marking rates were highest during the mating season, when individuals in reproductive condition marked significantly more often than non-reproductive animals. During the cub-rearing season females marked at a significantly higher rate than males, and in both sexes adults scent-marked significantly more frequently than younger individuals. Approximately 30% of all scent-marks received an over-mark within 24 h of their deposit. In males over-marking behaviour was recorded only during the mating season, whereas females over-marked in all seasons at equal rates. Overall, our results suggest that in addition to their territorial functions, subcaudal scent-marks also serve as individual-specific advertisement signals directed at other group-members.},

journal = {Ecosphere},
volume = {7},

pages = {11},
abstract = {European badgers (Meles meles) use shared defecation sites, termed latrines, to demarcate group ranges. While some latrines are small, comprising few pits with few fresh scats spread over a small area, others are large, comprising many pits with many fresh droppings and extending over a large area. Although many studies have investigated badger latrine usage patterns, and speculated on latrine -function, this variation in relative latrine size remains unexplained. Using nearest neighbor analyses, we analyzed the latrine positioning, use, and inter-latrine distances from four study areas with different population densities. We found that latrines were spaced regularly throughout the range, and border marking was prioritized, increasing the chances of traversing badgers intercepting a latrine. While the numbers of latrines increased with group range size, the number of fresh feces per latrine decreased, suggesting that fresh feces may be a limiting resource in the maintenance of latrines, and that maintaining latrine spacing pattern is more important than the actual number of fresh feces in each latrine. We thus posited that, where territories are small and groups large, the capacity to produce feces exceeds the minimum need for perimeter marking, resulting in fecal redundancy and large latrines. In contrast, in larger territories, especially when occupied by smaller groups, badgers may experience fecal constraint, thus maintaining smaller latrines. We concluded that latrine maintenance and fecal scent-marking activity in badgers involves a trade-off between group size and group range area, leading to different degrees of fecal constraint, while energetic costs of signaling are minimized.},

abstract = {Although it is broadly accepted that small mammals often climb trees, only few studies explore arboreality in woodland rodents systematically. Here, we investigate the three-dimensional habitat use of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus and bank voles Myodes glareolus at three different sites in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, under varying environmental conditions. A total of 12 trapping sessions was carried out between March and September 2003 and 2004. During each session, 100 Longworth live-traps with shrew escape holes were set in a 25-point-grid for 3 succeeding nights. Each time, 50 traps were placed on the ground, and 50 in surrounding trees at heights of 30-250 cm. Wood mice were significantly more arboreal than bank voles, and male wood mice spent significantly more time in trees than did females. Arboreality in bank voles occurred only under high population densities and food shortage, and both species were significantly more arboreal in woodland with dense understorey. Thus we conclude that while arboreality is predominantly a result of inter- and intra-specific competition, of the two species we studied, only wood mice, being more agile, can afford to utilize trees without getting caught by predators, and that sex differences are due to male territoriality. Estimates of population sizes and distribution, as well as studies of inter-specific interactions and socio-spatial behaviour are presumed to be affected by these results, and are currently likely to underestimate rodent numbers considerably.

volume = {140},
pages = {965-980},
abstract = {The adaptive significance of sociality in European badgers (Meles meles) is often explained on the basis of ecological factors, but little is known about their social interactions. Here, we investigate how allo-marking of conspecifics with subcaudal gland secretions might serve as a behavioural mechanism to create a shared group-odour, thus functioning simultaneously to maintain group cohesion, and as an individual advertisement signal. The odour of subcaudal secretions, which encodes group-membership and individual-specific information, is partly generated by the bacterial flora in the subcaudal pouch. Studying the interactions of 40 different adults from two social groups, we analysed 3021 instances of allo-marking, which may be either mutual, i.e. two badgers pressing their subcaudal pouches against each other simultaneously (155 events) or sequential, i.e. one badger marking the body of another individual (2866 events). Sequential marking is significantly more frequent than mutual marking, although both occur significantly more often during the mating season and the cub-rearing season than at other times. Whereas mutual marking appears to be independent of individual-specific parameters, sequential allo-marking is strongly influenced by sex, age, and reproductive status. We propose that mutual marking generates a common group-smell by facilitating the exchange of pouch bacteria, thus aiding in group-cohesion, while sequential marking serves two purposes, to distribute the common group-smell, and to advertise individual-specific, fitness-related information. Strong correlation of the frequencies of sequential and mutual allo-marking as well as the allo-grooming behaviour between particular clusters of group members suggests the existence of sub-groups within badger groups.},

abstract = {A survey of Skomer voles (Clethrionomys glareolus skomerensis) conducted in August of 1994 and 1995 discovered that 51% of live-trapped animals were positive for Cryptosporidium species (Coccidia). Of the positive animals, 85% were shedding C. muris in their faeces, 5% C. parvum and 10% apparently both parasite species. On the U.K. mainland, the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) is a quarter of that on Skomer and the species normally found is C. parvum. Interest in C. parvum stems from the often severe diarrhoeal disease cryptosporidiosis which it can cause in humans and livestock. The parasite occupies the gastro-intestinal tract and is transmitted between hosts by the faecal-oral route. It has been suggested that wild rodents may be an important reservoir of infection by C. parvum for livestock. However, on Skomer island, C. muris, which is rarely found in livestock, is the dominant species infecting voles.},

abstract = {Parasite loads of animals vary among individuals, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully identified. Here, we investigated whether health status of hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) is correlated with tick burden, and whether chemical cues linked to the health status of the host mediate attraction of the tick Ixodes hexagonus. An ecological survey conducted over 10 years, involving 226 wild hedgehogs, revealed a strong association between health status and tick burden of hedgehogs, with healthy animals being less likely to carry ticks than unhealthy ones. Behavioral choice tests demonstrated that ticks display a preference for the fecal odor from sick hedgehogs compared with healthy ones. Chemical analysis of fecal odors using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry showed differences in the odor profile between sick and healthy hedgehogs. Sick animals tended to exhibit raised levels of the volatile aromatic heterocyclic compound indole in their feces. Ticks were attracted to indole when given the choice between indole and a solvent control. However, fecal matter from healthy hosts, with the addition of indole, was not attractive to ticks, suggesting that indole interacts with other, undetected compounds in mediating attraction. This study implies that it is the attraction to fecal odor that causes higher tick burdens in sick hedgehogs. Ticks might benefit from this preference by avoiding possible repulsion mechanisms of healthy hosts. We suggest that ticks potentially choose their host based on odor linked to the host's health status.},

Between 1996 and 2001 a total of 465 edible dormice were captured, of which 392 have been marked with PIT tags. Reproductive failure was observed in 1996, 1998 and 2001 when no males developed conspicuous testes nor were females found lactating. Reproduction occurred in 1997, 1999 and 2000. Using the minimum number of animals alive method we determined that population density shows high inter-annual variability with between 0.6-4.1 per hectare but is lower than in continental Europe. In contrast average litter size was 6.8, higher than in their native range. Survivorship did not differ between years or between sexes.},

abstract = {During summer the brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus (Vespertilionidae) forms stable colonies, comprised of both adult females and males and young of the year. A long-term ringing study conducted in north-east Scotland has established that little movement occurs among colonies and that both sexes are recruited into their natal colony. The aim of the present study was to investigate, using microsatellite DNA markers, if genetic structure within the population reflects the spatial structure indicated by ringing. Inter-colony F(ST)estimates obtained for all colony members, and for females and males separately, were low (0.019, 0.026 and 0.011, respectively), but all values differed significantly from zero. These data indicate high gene flow between colonies, although some coancestry among colony members is evident in both sexes. On combining the ringing and genetic data, it is concluded chat gene flow occurs via extracolony copulation, rather than natal dispersal, and that each colony behaves as a distinct subpopulation. Microgeographical genetic isolation by distance was demonstrated for, to our knowledge, the first time in a bat species, and found to be apparent both across the entire study area and along one river valley. The results suggest that extensive macrogeographical population genetic structure may be evident across the species' range.},

pages = {209-219},
abstract = {In the wild, rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are social but territorial. Recent surveys suggest that over half of pet rabbits are housed singly. We aimed to compare welfare in single versus paired rabbits. We predicted singletons would show more abnormal or escape behaviour, greater stress responses to handling, and reduced body temperature (being unable to huddle with another individual when cold), but that pairs may show aggression. This study was conducted during winter at a rabbit-only rescue centre, and included 45 rabbits, comprising 15 housed singly and 15 pairs. Like most pet rabbits, they were housed either outdoors or in unheated outbuildings. Singletons were mostly in smaller enclosures than pairs. Home-pen observations (40 min) revealed bar-biting in 8/15 single rabbits compared with 0/30 of the paired ones. No other behavioural effects of social housing reached significance, and enclosure size showed no significant effects. Body temperature was significantly lower in singletons than pairs, with at least 0.5 degrees C mean difference. On colder days, rabbits adopted compact postures more, and relaxed postures less frequently. After handling, pairs resumed normal behaviour significantly more quickly than singletons in the home-pen (3.0 [+/- 0.3] versus 8.3 [+/- 1.3] s, respectively). Aggression was never observed. The results indicate that social housing reduces bar-biting, aids thermoregulation, and may help buffer stress. Rabbit owners should be encouraged to meet the need for rabbits to be housed with an appropriate conspecific in a suitably large, sheltered enclosure.},

Cowpox prevalence was monitored longitudinally for 2 years, in populations of field voles exhibiting multiannual cycles of density in Kielder Forest, UK. 3. The probability that available susceptible animals seroconverted in a given trap session was significantly positively related to host density with a 3-month time lag. 4. Males were significantly more likely to seroconvert than females. 5. Despite most infection being found in young animals (because transmission rates were generally high) mature individuals were more likely to seroconvert than immature ones, suggesting that behavioural or physiological changes associated with maturity contribute to variation in infection risk. 6. Hence, these analyses confirm that there is a delayed numerical response of cowpox infection to vole density, supporting the hypothesis that endemic pathogens may play some part in shaping vole cycles.},

abstract = {Rodents that have multi-annual cycles of density are known to have flexible growth strategies, and the "Chitty effect", whereby adults in the high-density phase of the cycle exhibit larger average body mass than during the low phase, is a well-documented feature of cyclic populations. Despite this, there have been no studies that have repeatedly monitored individual vole growth over time from all phases of a density cycle, in order to evaluate whether such variation in body size is due to differences in juvenile growth rates, differences in growth periods, or differential survival of particularly large or small voles. This study compares growth trajectories from voles during the peak, increase and crash phases of the cycle in order to evaluate whether voles are exhibiting fast or slow growth strategies. We found that although voles reach highest asymptotic weights in the peak phase and lowest asymptotes during the crash, initial growth rates were not significantly different. This suggests that voles attain larger body size during the peak phase as a result of growing for longer.},

abstract = {A typical badger (Meles meles) territory contains a primary burrow or 'main sea' plus several secondary burrows or 'outlier setts'. The main aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that outlier seas are used as emergency refuges, by subjecting foraging radio-collared badgers to three levels of experimental disturbance (low, moderate and high). In addition, we recorded the occurrence of potential alarm signals. With low-level disturbance, badgers usually returned to the main sea even when this was further away than the nearest outlier sett; with high-level disturbance they always took refuge in the nearest outlier; and with moderate-level disturbance they showed no dear preference. We conclude that outlier seas do act as emergency refuges, but only when an animal is badly frightened. Possible alarm signals (pilo-erection, head-flagging, snorting and growling) occurred mainly during moderate or high-level disturbance but even then they were relatively infrequent. Signals were no more likely to be emitted when conspecifics were near by than when the signaller was alone, and when conspecifics were present they rarely reacted either to the flight of the disturbed animal or to any signals that it emitted. We conclude that such alarm signals as do occur constitute threats directed towards the predator rather than warnings for the benefit of conspecifics.},

abstract = {The European badger, Meles meles, constructs burrows ('setts') of various sizes and types, some of which are very large and complex. The hypothesis that large setts allow badgers to move regularly from one nest chamber to another, thereby avoiding accumulation of ectoparasites, was tested. The ectoparasite load of 32 wild badgers was measured and the daytime sleeping locations of 33 radiocollared individuals, 16 of which were treated with anti-parasite spray, recorded. Untreated badgers were infested with fleas, ticks and lice, and they regularly shifted from one sleeping site to another within a sett, rarely spending more than 2 or 3 consecutive clays at the same site. Anti-parasite treatment decreased the frequency with which badgers switched to different nest sites. Badgers did not choose sleeping sites at random when returning to the sett each morning: they tended to return more often than would be expected by chance to a site that they had occupied the previous day, and less often than expected to a site that had been vacated by another member of the group on the preceding night. Badgers may thus remain in the same nest until perceived ectoparasite challenge exceeds a certain threshold and avoid nests recently vacated by a conspecific because the level of infestation of such nests is also likely to exceed the threshold. Use of multiple nests as a defence against ectoparasites may be a common trait in burrowing mammals. (C) 1996 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract = {The distribution and relative abundance of the Pygmy and Common shrews were investigated over two years at 42 sites across northern England and at a further seven sites in one year. Most of the sites were in upland areas above 250 m in altitude. At almost all sites, the Pygmy shrew was more abundant than the Common shrew, often by a considerable margin. On heather Calfuna, cotton-grass Eriophorum vaginaturn and moor rush Juncus squarrosus dominated areas, the Pygmy shrew greatly outnumbered the Common shrew and only on mineral soils with grasses was there near equality in numbers. Pygmy shrews were captured at the highest site, Great Dun Fell summit (847 m) but Common shrews were not found above 674 m.
A correlation exists between the numbers of shrews captured at a site and the abundance of invertebrates revealed by pitfall trapping. It is recorded that Common shrews fed on earthworms (which are almost completely absent on peatlands) whilst Pygmy shrews did not use them as food even on the mineral soil grasslands. In contrast, Pygmy shrews fed more extensively on surface living invertebrates such as harvest spiders, adult moths and adult flies. It is suggested that the distribution of earthworms is primarily responsible for determining the abundance of Common shrews whilst the densities of other invertebrates influence the abundance of Pygmy shrews. The onset of breeding in the Pygmy shrew each year does not appear to be delayed at high altitude and litter size is similar to that in lowland areas. There is evidence to suggest that Pygmy shrews live longer in their second year of life at high altitudes and breed longer (on average), possibly resulting in a great reproductive success per adult.},

journal = {Wildlife Biology},
pages = {7},
abstract = {The European brown hare Lepus europaeus is an r-selected species showing relatively high fecundity, and changes in the hare population can be influenced by the timing of hunting and reproductive activity. Between February and August in Europe, the majority of female hares are either pregnant or suckling young, or both, and if a female is killed during the suckling period, the young hares (leverets) are orphaned and are likely to die of starvation. In England and Wales, in contrast with other European countries, there is no close season when hunting hares is prohibited, and the peak time of hunting in February coincides with the start of reproductive activity. We explore the impact of hunting practices on the risk of death by starvation of dependent young. By modelling scenarios of hunting at the highest documented rate at times of the year based on practices adopted in England and Wales, and by comparing this with the close season practice in Scotland, we quantify seasonally variable risks of orphaning and death by starvation of leverets. Hunting in February leads to a profoundly damaging combination of population shrinkage (lambda= 0.534) and levels of orphaning of leverets corresponding to 7.6% of the year start population and thus providing poor welfare and poor population recovery outcomes for the hare. These illustrative figures compare very unfavourably with the modelled Scottish population which has a growth rate of lambda=1.404 and levels of orphaning of leverets corresponding to 0.3% of the year start population. We anticipate that these findings will stimulate consideration of the impact of hunting practices, and that increased understanding of the effects of the timing of hunting may aid policy development aimed at protecting dependent young hares.},

abstract = {Understanding how key parameters (e.g., density, range-size, and configuration) can affect animal movement remains a major goal of population ecology. This is particularly important for wildlife disease hosts, such as the European badger Meles meles, a reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis. Here we show how movements of 463 individuals among 223 inferred group territories across 755 km(2) in Ireland were affected by sex, age, past-movement history, group composition, and group size index from 2009 to 2012. Females exhibited a greater probability of moving into groups with a male-biased composition, but male movements into groups were not associated with group composition. Male badgers were, however, more likely to make visits into territories than females. Animals that had immigrated into a territory previously were more likely to emigrate in the future. Animals exhibiting such "itinerant" movement patterns were more likely to belong to younger age classes. Inter-territorial movement propensity was negatively associated with group size, indicating that larger groups were more stable and less attractive (or permeable) to immigrants. Across the landscape, there was substantial variation in inferred territory-size and movement dynamics, which was related to group size. This represents behavioral plasticity previously only reported at the scale of the species' biogeographical range. Our results highlight how a "one-size-fits-all" explanation of badger movement is likely to fail under varying ecological contexts and scales, with implications for bovine tuberculosis management.},

abstract = {European badgers Meles meles are vectors of bovine tuberculosis, and may have negative impacts on the cattle grazing industry. In order to control tuberculosis in badger populations, the use of baits containing vaccines or fertility control agents has been proposed. However, in social species such as badgers, multiple bait uptake and competition for baits at baiting stations could reduce the efficiency of baiting campaigns. We used video surveillance and Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT)-tag systems to monitor the behaviour of two social groups of badgers offered plain baits. We recorded the following data: (i) proportion of baits taken by badgers/by non-target species; (ii) potential occurrence of caching; (iii) potential occurrence of bait monopolisation and competition. Badgers removed 97.8% of baits. There was no evidence of bait uptake by non-target species. Some 85% of the baits were immediately eaten at the baiting station; caching was not observed although it cannot be excluded. In 1/3 of visits, badgers consumed two or more baits. In 30% of all visits, the contemporary presence of two or more badgers searching for baits was recorded. In three instances badgers were observed to compete for baits. This study shows evidence of aggressive behaviour and direct competition for food by free-living badgers. Bait monopolisation and intra-specific competition at feeding stations could influence bait uptake and should be evaluated in other wildlife species when bait-delivered vaccines or contraceptives are use.},

abstract = {Baits are increasingly used in wildlife management to deliver orally administered vaccines and contraceptives. The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of vaccination or fertility-control campaigns can be substantially affected by bait uptake rates. This study assessed whether bait type and deployment strategy affected bait uptake by free-living badgers (Meles meles L.). Six social groups of badgers were presented with three bait types (meat, fruit, cereals) and two deployment strategies (dispersed single baits versus aggregated multiple baits at fixed baiting stations) for six weeks. In each social group, the type of bait and deployment strategy were rotated every week so that by the end of the test every group had experienced all combinations. On three days, biomarkers (ethyl iophenoxic acid, propyl iophenoxic acid and rhodamine B) were added to the baits to determine the proportion of badgers ingesting these baits. The results indicated that both bait type and deployment strategy affected the proportion of baits eaten by badgers and the number of badgers gaining access to baits. Meat and fruit baits were taken significantly more frequently than cereals, and dispersed meat baits had the highest rates of disappearance. Biomarker levels suggested that the proportion of badgers that gained access to all baits was substantially lower when baits were aggregated, although small sample sizes prevented statistical assessment of this effect. The results suggest that dispersed single baits are likely to be consumed in greater proportions by a higher number of individual badgers than multiple baits at fixed stations.},

Four decades after their introduction to islands in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, European hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus continue to be an important nest predator for a declining population of breeding waders. Where hedgehogs were rare, clutch survival rates (assessed using nest temperature loggers) of five species of waders (dunlin Calidris alpina, lapwing Vanellus vanellus, redshank Tringa totanus, snipe Gallinago gallinago and ringed plover Charadrius hiaticula) were higher than where hedgehogs were relatively more abundant. Hedgehogs were the most frequent nest predator identified using cameras. However, factors influencing population sizes of breeding waders are complex and unlikely to be attributable to a single species of predator. The interactions between predation, land use, habitat and the changes in each deserve further attention.},

abstract = {Capsule Changing agricultural activity and soil chemistry appear to be associated with some changes in breeding wader assemblages on the machair of the Outer Hebrides, Scotland, between the 1980s and 2000s. Aims To identify potential factors in addition to nest predation by Hedgehogs that could have driven changes in machair breeding wader assemblage of the Western Isles. Methods Surveys of breeding waders in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s and of vegetation in 1976 and 2009 were carried out on machair habitats on the west coast of Uist (four study sites). Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify associations between: (1) breeding wader densities in 2007-2010 and vegetation metrics (Ellenberg indicator values, axes determined by detrended correspondence analyses and structural measures) derived from the 2009 vegetation survey and (2) changes in breeding wader densities between 1983-1987 and 2007-2010 and changes in vegetation metrics derived from surveys in 1976 and 2009. Reported changes in agricultural use were assessed from interviews with local land managers to assess the likely influence of land-use changes on vegetation and breeding waders. Results Changes in population densities of breeding waders differed between species and sites over the three decades. Overall, Eurasian Oystercatcher and Common Redshank increased. Common Ringed Plover, Dunlin and possibly Common Snipe decreased and there were no significant changes for Northern Lapwing. Changes in vegetation indicated relatively small decreases in soil fertility of machair grassland cultivation, increased soil salinity and a decrease in overall vegetation cover. Higher breeding wader densities were associated with higher values of soil moisture, pH, fertility, salinity, vegetation height, vegetation density and extent of cultivation with inter-specific differences mostly associated with vegetation structure. Where soil fertility declined, Ringed Plover and Dunlin tended to decline while Oystercatcher increased. Temporal changes in Lapwing density were positively associated with changes in soil moisture. Ringed Plover density changes were positively associated with indicators of vegetation shade intolerance, soil acidity, soil fertility and reduced soil salinity. Changes of Redshank were positively associated with vegetation height. Reported changes in land use included a reduction in the number of people practising cultivation, though not necessarily in the area cultivated, reductions in numbers of grazing cattle and increases in numbers of sheep, a switch from using seaweed and farmyard manure to using compound fertilizers and deeper ploughing. Conclusions Although pointing to some interesting changes in machair systems associated with soil fertility, moisture and salinity that may have affected breeding waders, possibly acting through alterations to food supplies, further understanding of how waders use the mosaic of habitats is required to understand potential mechanisms. The importance of vegetation changes relative to, and interacting with, predation deserves further attention.},

abstract = {Badgers are facultatively social, forming large groups at high density. Group-living appears to have high reproductive costs for females, and may lead to increased levels of inbreeding. The extent of female competition for reproduction has been estimated from field data, but knowledge of male reproductive success and the extent of extra-group paternity remains limited. Combining field data with genetic data (16 microsatellite loci), we studied the mating system of 10 badger social groups across 14 years in a high-density population. From 923 badgers, including 425 cubs, we were able to assign maternity to 307 cubs, with both parents assigned to 199 cubs (47%) with 80% confidence, and 14% with 95% confidence. Age had a significant effect on the probability of reproduction, seemingly as a result of a deficit of individuals aged two years and greater than eight years attaining parentage. We estimate that approximately 30% of the female population successfully reproduced in any given year, with a similar proportion of the male population gaining paternity across the same area. While it was known there was a cost to female reproduction in high density populations, it appears that males suffer similar, but not greater, costs. Roughly half of assigned paternity was attributed to extra-group males, the majority of which were from neighbouring social groups. Few successful matings occurred between individuals born in the same social group (22%). The high rate of extra-group mating, previously unquantified, may help reduce inbreeding, potentially making philopatry a less costly strategy.},

abstract = {1. The spatial and temporal scale at which infectious animals pose a transmission risk to others may be inferred by a study of space-time interaction in the clustering of cases of infection. 2. We analyse the distribution of bank voles and wood mice infectious with cowpox virus, using 7 years of monthly live-trapping data from a woodland in north-west England. 3. A published method, K-function analysis, is adapted to measure space-time interaction among infectious animals trapped on a grid system, where the populations at risk may vary in density. 4. We hypothesized that the risk of cowpox transmission from an infectious animal would be contained within a temporal scale of one infectious period and a spatial scale of one home-range diameter. 5. Cowpox cases among wood mice showed significantly greater spatial clustering than the population at risk at the smallest spatial scale, corresponding to animals caught in the same location. At larger scales, and for bank voles at all scales, cowpox cases showed no spatial clustering beyond that expected from an association with host distribution. 6. Cowpox cases among wood mice showed strong evidence of temporal clustering beyond that of the host population, indicating short-lived outbreaks. No such effect was apparent among bank voles. 7. Significant space-time interaction among cowpox cases was detected at the hypothesized spatial and temporal scales in both host species. This suggests that the risk of transmission is concentrated locally. 8. Results are discussed in terms of transmission, including consideration of the appropriateness of distance and nearest-neighbour based clustering tests to infections transmitted by local density and frequency dependent mechanisms.},

abstract = {The water vole has recently undergone a catastrophic decline in the UK. This has resulted from loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat leaving water vole populations highly vulnerable to the impact of predation by introduced American mink. However, at some reedbed sites water voles and mink have apparently coexisted for many years. To determine if reedbeds offer a refuge from predation, 70 voles were radio-tagged at three sites in England and overwinter mortality monitored. Water vole perception of predation risk was also assessed. Mortality was high (64%), predation by mustelids, including mink, being the chief cause. Experiments suggested that voles failed to perceive areas of highest predation risk. However, predation rate declined strongly with the distance water voles lived from a main water channel. Thus, reedbeds provide a refuge from predation, even by mink, and calculations suggest that they may support source populations enhancing the viability of water vole metapopulations. Consequently reedbeds are now being used as one focus for the conservation of water voles in England and Wales. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Eurasian badger ( Meles meles) is implicated in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis ( TB) to cattle in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Badger culling has been employed for the control of TB in cattle in both countries, with varying results. Social perturbation of badger populations following culling has been proposed as an explanation for the failure of culling to consistently demonstrate significant reductions in cattle TB. Field studies indicate that culling badgers may result in increased immigration into culled areas, disruption of territoriality, increased ranging and mixing between social groups. Our analysis shows that some measures of sociality may remain significantly disrupted for up to 8 years after culling. This may have epidemiological consequences because previous research has shown that even in a relatively undisturbed badger population, movements between groups are associated with increases in the incidence of Mycobacterium bovis infection. This is consistent with the results from a large-scale field trial, which demonstrated decreased benefits of culling at the edges of culled areas, and an increase in herd breakdown rates in neighbouring cattle.},

The first result but not the second agrees with the prediction of the model of the ideal free distribution (FRETWELL & LUCAS, 1970). A conceptual model named Ideal Non-territorial Despotic Distribution was derived empirically to explain the distribution of hedgehogs in open meadows. INDD differs from other models in that competitors are free to move (1) outside the system and (2) between foraging sites as long as they keep an individual space, such that bad competitors are prevented to entering the best sites when these are saturated with good competitors.},

abstract = {We conducted a field experiment at a 4-ha sports ground in Oxford between May and August 1992 to analyse the role of learning and social organization in the short-term responses of hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus to manipulations of food availability. On six nights we uniformly distributed 36 'prey' (cat food chunks) twice a night in an 70 x 70 m area (the 'patch'). Prey were placed at sites marked with small flags. In a subsequent experiment lasting five nights, non-marked and randomly distributed prey were provided. We regularly mapped the position of individuals, before, during and after both food supplementation treatments. Hedgehogs showed a stable pattern of spatial utilisation of the habitat during the non-hibernation months prior to experimental perturbation. Addition of food to parts of the habitat significantly and rapidly changed these patterns. a) Hedgehog density increased in food supplemented parts of the habitat. b) Hedgehogs learned to associate visual cues with the presence of food. c) Hedgehogs learned the spatial location of patches. d) Hedgehogs probably engaged in 'area restricted' searching. Hedgehogs had overlapping home ranges but showed a uniform distribution within patches and avoided conspecifics at distance <30 m. The number of different individuals visiting the area decreased throughout the experiment. Food addition did not significantly change the mean density of hedgehogs, perhaps because social interactions placed an upper limit on density in the areas with supplementary food.},

abstract = {Radio-tracking was used to determine the foraging behaviour and habitat use of the serotine bat, Eptesicus serotinus, at two roosts in southern England. The bars commuted an average of 6.5 km to and from distinct foraging sites and used up to five sites per night. Serotines foraged in a wide range of habitats and were able to locate and exploit temporary feeding sites such as recently mown grass. They foraged regularly around white streetlamps and in late summer over cattle pasture on which fresh dung was present. Reproductively active females were strongly philopatric to their day-roost. In contrast, reproductively inactive females, from the same roosts, moved to new day-roosts up to 10 km from the site of capture. Serotines used three distinct foraging strategies: short flights, ground feeding, and, predominantly, aerial hawking. Foraging bouts were interspersed with resting phases, with individuals roosting alone on walls of houses or in trees close to foraging sites. It is concluded that serotines are well adapted to an anthropogenic environment. They are strongly philopatric to roosts in human habitations, in close proximity to a range of feeding sites where they can take advantage of favourable land management practices.},

abstract = {Activity patterns and emergence times of a colony of serotine bats, Eptesicus serotinus, were studied in southern England. Time of emergence from the day roost varied over the summer but was strongly correlated with sunset. Mean emergence time was 11.6 +/- 7.7 min after sunset. Early in summer, activity patterns were unimodal, becoming bimodal during mid- to late pregnancy and multimodal in early to mid-lactation. When juveniles were volant, activity patterns became unimodal again. Periods of low ambient temperature were associated with reduced activity. The duration of the first foraging flight decreased as pregnancy progressed, possibly as a result of the greater wing-loading caused by increased body mass. However, the first foraging flight increased in duration during the course of lactation, probably in response to a combination of increased night length and the increased energetic demands of milk production. It is concluded that seasonal variation in the length of time spent away from the roost in the serotine is related to reproductive status, night length and ambient temperature. It is suggested that the more northerly distribution of this bat in continental Europe may be due to differences in habitat use and diet.},

number = {19},
pages = {3788-3799},
abstract = {Infectious disease introduced by non-native species is increasingly cited as a facilitator of native population declines, but direct evidence may be lacking due to inadequate population and disease prevalence data surrounding an outbreak. Previous indirect evidence and theoretical models support squirrelpox virus (SQPV) as being potentially involved in the decline of red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) following the introduction of the non-native gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) to the United Kingdom. The red squirrel is a major UK conservation concern and understanding its continuing decline is important for any attempt to mitigate the decline. The red squirrel-gray squirrel system is also exemplary of the interplay between infectious disease (apparent competition) and direct competition in driving the replacement of a native by an invasive species. Time series data from Merseyside are presented on squirrel abundance and squirrelpox disease (SQPx) incidence, to determine the effect of the pathogen and the nonnative species on the native red squirrel populations. Analysis indicates that SQPx in red squirrels has a significant negative impact on squirrel densities and their population growth rate (PGR). There is little evidence for a direct gray squirrel impact; only gray squirrel presence (but not density) proved to influence red squirrel density, but not red squirrel PGR. The dynamics of red SQPx cases are largely determined by previous red SQPx cases, although previous infection of local gray squirrels also feature, and thus, SQPV-infected gray squirrels are identified as potentially initiating outbreaks of SQPx in red squirrels. Retrospective serology indicates that approximately 8% of red squirrels exposed to SQPV may survive infection during an epidemic. This study further highlights the UK red squirrel - gray squirrel system as a classic example of a native species population decline strongly facilitated by infectious disease introduced by a non-native species. It is therefore paramount that disease prevention and control measures are integral in attempts to conserve red squirrels in the United Kingdom.},

journal = {Mammal Review},
volume = {24},
number = {3},
pages = {113-160},
abstract = {The origins, early history, captive populations, spread and habitat preferences of Reeves' Muntjac in Britain are reviewed. It is suggested that much of the published information on the history of Muntjac in Britain is based on misconceptions, and that each subsequent report has continued to promulgate a false impression on the origins, time-scale and pattern of spread of the species in Britain. Indian and Reeves' Muntjac were introduced to Woburn Park in Bedfordshire within a year of each other, and it appears that the Indian Muntjac did not thrive, at least in the decade following their introduction. How long they survived as a free-living species in Britain is unclear, but it was probably only a few years. However, there is some evidence to suggest that they might have persisted within the Park at Woburn until 1930. Following the first releases from Woburn in 1901, the numbers of free-living Reeves' Muntjac in Britain remained low until the 1920s, when populations were largely confined to the woods around Woburn, and possibly also around Tring in Hertfordshire. However, in the 1930s and 1940s there were further deliberate introductions in selected areas some distance from Woburn. As a consequence, the subsequent spread of Reeves' Muntjac was from several main foci, i.e. from the vicinity of Woburn, the Norfolk/Suffolk border, three sites in Northamptonshire, two sites in Oxfordshire and two in Warwickshire. The spread in the second half of this century has been aided by further deliberate and accidental releases, and by these means new populations continue to be established outside the main range. Thus the natural spread has been much less impressive than previously assumed; even in areas with established populations it takes a long time for Muntjac to colonize all the available habitat. Data from a number of areas in Britain suggest that the natural rate of spread is about 1 km a year, which is comparable to other species of deer in Britain. The many introductions have complicated an analysis of the habitat preferences of Reeves' Muntjac, and no clear trends could be found. It would appear that Reeves' Muntjac are less dependent on specific types of habitat than previously believed. Examination of the land-class preferences using resource selection indices showed that arable land classes were predominantly selected for, and that marginal upland land classes tended to be avoided. Subsequent logistic regression models based on the land classes selected (and to a lesser extent avoided) by Muntjac were able to predict accurately the current distribution of Reeves' Muntjac in Britain, and one of these, together with our knowledge of their history and spread, was used to infer those areas most likely to be colonized by Muntjac in the near future. The greatest potential for range expansion is in Kent and Sussex, and to a lesser extent north into Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and south Yorkshire, and west into Cheshire and north Shropshire. However, long-established populations in areas such as Betws-y-Coed in Wales show that Muntjac may persist in low numbers in atypical habitats. Future habitat changes, such as the planting of new woodlands, and continued deliberate and accidental releases, are likely to lead to population changes in addition to those predicted by the logistic regression model.},

abstract = {The ranging behaviour, activity and social organization of sympatric populations of Reeves' muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in a mainly commercial coniferous forest in eastern England were studied by means of radio-tracking techniques. Muntjac showed no seasonal changes in range size; muntjac bucks had significantly larger ranges than does at all times of the year. For roe deer there were significant seasonal changes in home-range size; bucks had largest ranges in the winter months and smallest ranges in September-October, whereas does had largest ranges during January-February and minimum ranges during May-June. There was no seasonal change in the number or size of muntjac core areas; bucks always had larger and more numerous core areas than does. Neither was there a seasonal change in the number or size of roe deer core areas; whilst there was no difference in the number of core areas for roe bucks and does, those of bucks were significantly smaller. There was no seasonal change in daily distance travelled by muntjac bucks or does, or roe bucks, but there was a significant seasonal trend for roe docs, whose daily distances travelled were longest during January-February and shortest during May-June. Spatial organization of muntjac consisted of groups of overlapping doe ranges but exclusive buck ranges; these overlapped with one or more groups of doe ranges. During the summer, roe deer buck and doe ranges overlapped, and some doe ranges were shared with other adult does, but buck ranges were exclusive. During the winter, roe deer were more wide-ranging and mixed more freely. There was no evidence for spatial separation of muntjac and roe deer; minimum convex polygon ranges overlapped and core areas often coincided. Mean annual activity was 69.3 +/- 1.5% for muntjac and 56.4 +/- 1.8% for roe deer. Mean length of active periods was significantly greater for muntjac than roe deer, and roe deer had significantly longer inactive periods. For muntjac there were peaks of activity at dusk and dawn, with lower levels of activity during the day and night. For roe deer the dawn and dusk peaks were more clearly defined, and at most times of the year nocturnal activity was higher than diurnal activity. These results are discussed in relation to the physiology of the two species and their patterns of space and food utilization, and the evidence for resource partitioning between the two species is evaluated. It was shown that neither muntjac nor roe deer had an effect on the ranging behaviour, activity and social organization of the other species, but that at very high densities muntjac can have an impact on established roe deer populations by changing their pattern of habitat utilization and by locally reducing their numbers.},

abstract = {Unlike most species of deer, Reeves' muntjac does not have a seasonal reproductive cycle. Births are equally distributed throughout the year and, irrespective of season of birth, females start breeding when they have reached a minimum body weight of about 10 kg. A significantly smaller proportion of females is born in the autumn/winter than the spring/summer, but there is no effect of maternal age or condition on foetal sex ratios for first or subsequent pregnancies. Whilst aseasonal breeding increases female productivity, males are only able to hold territories encompassing the ranges of a number of does for a relatively short period of time. It is argued that for muntjac theres much less inter-sexual variation in lifetime reproductive success than for seasonally-breeding polygynous cervids. Hence, although muntjac are sexually dimorphic and polygynous, females do not invest preferentially in male off spring. Young males can be fertile from 36 weeks of age,when their first antlers are still in velvet. Whilst season of birth has no effect on the rate of sexual development in females, it does for males, with autumn-born male fawns attaining sexual maturity earliest. This accelerated development occurs in the period following independence from the mother, and there is no evidence of a maternal cost in producing male fawns. Since the canine tusks are the main weapons for intra-sexual conflict, there could be clear gains in terms of reproductive success for males that attain sexual maturity, adult weight and adult tusk size quickly, even though their first antlers are much smaller than those of older bucks. The hypothesis is presented that, for muntjac, the majority of a male's lifetime reproductive success is achieved relatively early in life when the canine tusks are in pristine condition, and that bucks lose their territories, and associated access to oestrous does, once the canines are broken.},

abstract = {Little is known about the role of specific acoustic cues in mammal vocal communication systems. In the current study, we used resynthesized male red deer roars in a habituation-discrimination paradigm to determine whether female red deer are sensitive to shifts in formant frequencies corresponding to the natural variation between the vocal tract lengths of a small and large adult red deer male. Hinds habituated to a given size variant showed a significant dishabituation when they were presented with roars in which the formants had been modified to simulate the other size variant. The signficant reduction in behavioural response to final rehabituation playback showed this was not a chance rebound in response levels. Our results suggest that formants are salient for red deer hinds and that hinds can detect a shift in formant frequencies that may have biological significance. We discuss the possible functions of formant perception in female red deer and more generally in nonhuman mammals.},

abstract = {A new, widespread and important disease of rabbits, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), is concisely reviewed and discussed. RHD is an acute, infectious condition of adult rabbits and morbidity and mortality, after a relatively short incubation period, can be very high. The disease appears typically as a necrotizing hepatitis with associated haemorrhaging, and death occurs as a result of generalized organ dysfunction. RHD is caused by a calicivirus, antigenically related to a similar virus found in brown hares but distinct from other known caliciviruses, and is spread to susceptible rabbits by a number of routes and vectors. The disease is easily identified and can be effectively controlled in commercial and domestic rabbit populations by slaughter and vaccination regimes. The occurrence of pre-existing cross-reacting antibody in a proportion of rabbits unchallenged by the disease implies the presence of non-pathogenic strains of the virus, This antibody protects against-disease on subsequent exposure to RHD. Uniquely, pre-existing antibody does not occur in rabbits in Australia where, after accidental release, the virus is currently spreading rapidly.},

abstract = {Population size estimates are an integral part of any species conservation or management project. They are often used to evaluate the impact of management intervention and can be critical for making decisions for future management. Distance sampling and camera trapping of unmarked populations are commonly used for such a task as they can yield rapid and relatively inexpensive estimates of density. Yet, while accuracy is key for decision-making, the potential bias associated with densities estimated with each method have seldom been investigated and compared. We built a spatially-explicit individual based model to investigate the accuracy and precision of both monitoring techniques in estimating known densities. We used the wild boar population of the Forest of Dean, UK, as a case study because both methods have been employed in situ and offer the chance of using real life parameters in the model. Moreover, this is an introduced species in the UK that has the potential to impact natural and agricultural ecosystems. Therefore, improving the accuracy of density estimates is a priority for the species' management. We found that both distance sampling and camera trapping produce biased density estimates for unmarked populations. Despite large uncertainties, distance sampling estimates were on average closer to known densities than those from camera trapping, and robust to group size. Camera trapping estimates were highly sensitive to group size but could be improved with better survey design. This is the first time that the amount of bias associated with each method is quantified. Our model could be used to correct estimated field-based densities from distance sampling and camera trapping of wild boar and other species with similar life-history traits. Our work serves to increase confidence in the results produced by these two commonly-used methods, ensuring they can in turn be relied upon by wildlife managers and conservationists.

abstract = {Species of conservation concern, or those in conflict with man, are most efficiently managed with an understanding of their population dynamics. European bats exemplify the need for successful and cost-effective management for both reasons, often simultaneously. Across Europe, bats are protected, and the concept of Favourable Conservation Status (FCS) is used as a key tool for the assessment and licensing of disruptive actions to populations. However, for efficient decision-making, this assessment requires knowledge on the demographic rates and long-term dynamics of populations. We used capture-mark-recapture to describe demographic rates for the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) at two sites in England and investigate the transition rates between three stages: juveniles, immatures, and breeders. We then use these rates in an individual-based population dynamics model to investigate the expected trajectories for both populations. Our results demonstrate for the first time the presence and scale of temporal variation in this species' demography. We describe the lengthy prereproductive period (3.5 years) that female Serotines experience. Finally, we show how site-specific variation in demographic rates can produce divergent population trajectories. Effective management of European bat populations can be achieved through the understanding of life histories, and local demographic rates and population dynamics, in order to anticipate the presence of source and sink sites in the landscape. Using the Serotine bat in England, we show that these can be obtained from rigorous and systematic studies of long-term demographic datasets.},

We hypothesized that wild deer could potentially act as reservoirs of anthelmintic-resistant GI nematodes between livestock farms. Adult abomasal nematodes and faecal samples were collected from fallow (n = 24), red (n = 14) and roe deer (n = 10) from venison farms and areas of extensive or intensive livestock farming. Principal components analysis of abomasal nematode species composition revealed differences between wild roe deer grazing in the areas of intensive livestock farming, and fallow and red deer in all environments. Alleles for benzimidazole (BZ) resistance were identified in beta-tubulin of Haemonchus contortus of roe deer and phenotypic resistance confirmed in vitro by an egg hatch test (EC50 = 0.149 mu g ml(-1) +/- 0.13 mu g ml(-1)) on H. contortus eggs from experimentally infected sheep. This BZ-resistant H. contortus isolate also infected a calf experimentally. We present the first account of in vitro BZ resistance in wild roe deer, but further experiments should firmly establish the presence of phenotypic BZ resistance in vivo. Comprehensive in-field studies should assess whether nematode cross-transmission between deer and livestock occurs and contributes, in any way, to the development of resistance on livestock farms.},

The relatively low numbers of recaptures of N. jbdiens at successive trapping periods indicated nomadic behaviour. Both species were more active during darkness than during daylight, and were more active in spring and summer than in winter. High turnover of the shrew population was attributed to mortality and emigration. Emigration was possibly encouraged by competition for space, particularly for nesting sites.},

These studies have revealed that Water shrews feed on a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate prey from tiny freshwater dip- teran larvae to sizable fish and frogs. Although aquatic prey are seen to be the major dietary component in most studies, terrestrial prey are also important and may be eaten in an equal proportion. Laboratory studies have increased our knowledge of the foraging behaviour of Water shrews but there is still much to be learnt, especially about underwater prey location.

abstract = {Roads have two major impacts on the landscape with respect to badger populations: (1) the imposition of barriers that reduce or prevent dispersal, and (2) the increased mortality caused by road traffic. Road traffic is the largest single cause of recorded death for badgers Meles meles in Britain. We used data collected by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food during the mid-1980s to quantify the effects of roads on badger populations in south-west England. The probability of badger fatalities per km were expressed as ratios of the number of road deaths per unit length of road for different classes of roads. The relationship between badger road deaths and traffic load appeared to be asymptotic. Despite large differences in traffic load and traffic flow on motorways, dual carriageways, class A and class B roads, they all had similar rates of badger fatalities per unit length of road, which were approximately six times greater than that for class C roads. These results suggest that high traffic loads may discourage badgers from attempting to cross major roads, and that these may therefore reduce movements between adjacent groups. Traffic levels on Britain's roads have already increased by 26% since these data were collected. As traffic loads increase further in the next century, the mortality and fragmentation effects of roads on badger populations locally are likely to become increasingly significant.

abstract = {There has been growing interest in the determinants of the annual timing of biological phenomena, or phenology, in wild populations, but research on vertebrate taxa has primarily focused on the phenology of reproduction. We present here analyses of the phenology of the annual growth of a secondary sexual characteristic, antlers in red deer (Cervus elaphus) males. The long-term individual-based data from a wild population of red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland allow us to consider ecological factors influencing variation in the phenology of growth of antlers, and the implications of variation in antler growth phenology with respect to the phenotype of antler grown (antler mass) and annual breeding success. The phenology of antler growth was influenced by local environmental conditions: higher population density delayed both the start date (during spring) and the relative end date (in late summer) of antler growth, and warmer temperatures in the September and April prior to growth advanced start and end dates, respectively. Furthermore, there was variation between individuals in this phenotypic plasticity of start date, although not in that of end date of growth. The phenology of antler growth impacted on the morphology of antlers grown, with individuals who started and ended growth earliest having the heaviest antlers. The timing of antler growth phenology was associated with breeding success in the following mating season, independently of the mass of antlers grown: an earlier start of antler growth was associated with siring a higher number of the calves born the following spring. Our results suggest that the phenology of traits that are not directly correlated with offspring survival may also regularly show correlations with fitness.},

abstract = {Food competition between American mink and otters was measured by comparing the diets of sympatric mink and otter populations with those of allopatric populations. Niche breadth was narrower for otters than mink. Niche breadth was wider for both mink and otters on islands where they co-existed in comparison to that of the allopatric populations. Niche overlap was lower in sympatric populations on islands with mammalian prey, however, niche overlap was not reduced on small islands without mammalian prey. Obtained data suggest that mink and otter compete for food resources and, when alternative prey sources are available, mink become more generalist predators to avoid competition with otters. However, when alternative prey sources are not available, both species become more generalist.},

abstract = {In fallow deer (Dama dama), as well as in other lek-breeding ungulates, receptive females arriving at leks commonly join males that are defending large harems. This tendency enhances differences in harem size and mating success between males. It could occur because females independently move to the same males, because females are attracted to males with females, or because females are attracted to each other. Using controlled experiments with estrous female fallow deer, we show that, although females are more attracted to males with harems than to those without, they are as frequently attracted to groups of females without a male as to female groups with males. We conclude that female fallow deer joining leks are attracted to each other and copy each other's movements. As yet, there is no firm evidence in fallow deer or in other lek-breeding ungulates that females copy each other's choice of mating partners.},

abstract = {While many populations of large mammals are stable from year to year, some show persistent oscillations associated with high mortality. This article investigates the causes of variation in population stability in ungulates by comparing the contrasting dynamics of two naturally regulated island populations: the Soay sheep population of Hirta (St. Kilda), where numbers fluctuate by 60%-70% every 3 or 4 yr as a result of overcompensatory winter mortality, and the red deer population of the North Block of Rum, where numbers have been stable for over a decade. We suggest that the contrasting dynamics of these two populations are caused by differences in fecundity and maturation rate. Red deer show relatively low fecundity and slow maturation, and increases in population density depress both fecundity and juvenile survival. In contrast, the relatively rapid development of Soay sheep allows them to evade density-dependent effects on reproduction and survival until the population exceeds winter carrying capacity by a substantial margin, subsequently triggering overcompensatory mortality in late winter in all age classes.},

pages = {521-527},
abstract = {1. Managers of many ungulate populations seek to maximize to maximize the number and quality of mature males that can be harvested each year rather than the total harvest. Since competition between the sexes in dimorphic ungulates is commonly asymmetric and increasing population density depresses the growth and survival of males more than females, different culling policies may need to be applied to the two sexes to realize this objective. 2. In this paper, we use observed density-dependent changes in reproduction and survival in an unculled red deer (Cervus elaphus) population in the North Block of the Isle of Rum to model the responses of males and females to different levels of culling or predation. 3. Red deer populations not subject to predation or culling are likely to show an adult sex ratio with a bias towards females, lying between 1-5 females per male and 2.0 females per male. 4. Where males and females are subjected to the same rates of predation or culling, females will again predominate in the population. Under these circumstances, increasing the overall rate of culling or predation is unlikely to lead to a substantial increase in the number of males present for, as female numbers fall, the number of males produced declines. It may, however, lead to improvements in male growth. 5. Where females are subjected to lower annual culling rates than males (a common situation for red deer populations in Scotland), increasing the proportion of females culled can lead to a substantial increase in the number of mature males in the population as a result of improvements in male survival. Our models suggest that the maximum annual yield of mature males is likely to be achieved if all males of greater-than-or-equal-to 5 years and 16-20% of females greater-than-or-equal-to 1 year old are culled each year. Estates that currently cull less than 5% of their females may be able to raise their annual offtake of mature stags by as much as 30% by raising female culls to these levels.},

abstract = {In sexually dimorphic mammals, high population density is commonly associated with increased mortality of males relative to females and with female-biased adult sex ratios. This paper investigates the consequences of these changes on the distribution of male breeding success, the intensity of competition for females and the opportunity for sexual selection. After the red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) population of the North Block of Rum (Inner Hebrides) was released from culling, female numbers rose and male numbers declined, leading to an adult sex ratio of around one male to two females. This change was the result of increased mortality of males relative to females during the first two years of life; of increased emigration rates by young males; and of reduced immigration by males from outside the study area. The increasing bias in the adult sex ratio affected the timing of breeding as well as the distribution of mating success in males. As the adult sex ratio became increasingly biased towards females, the degree of skew in mating success (calculated across all harem-holders) increased, but mature males defended harems for shorter periods and a higher proportion of males held harems. In addition, a higher proportion of calves were fathered by immigrant males and the proportion fathered by males born in the study area declined. These results support the contention that, where high population density is associated with a female-biased adult sex ratio, competition for mates is likely to decline.},

journal = {Wildlife Research},
volume = {37},
number = {5},
pages = {413-417},
abstract = {Context. In studies of population dynamics, disease ecology and prevalence, point-sampling of data is a widely used sampling technique and capture-mark-recapture (CMR) is the most popular method of point sampling. Population estimates based on CMR are sensitive to deviations from the assumptions of the models such as equal catchability of all animals. Although consistent deviations from these assumptions can be accounted for in a robust statistical framework (e. g. identification of trap-shy animals), transient effects cannot be adequately incorporated in the statistical models and thus are expected to affect the accuracy of model predictions. In natural animal populations, parasitism is often transient but inevitable and studies showing behavioural changes, e. g. foraging strategies, as a result of infection are numerous. Thus, parasitism may represent a transient source of heterogeneity of trapping probability in small mammal populations and may affect accuracy of wildlife sampling techniques. Aims. The aim of the present study was to quantify the effect of parasitic status on capture rates of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), and thus the potential for parasitism to act as a source of bias in wildlife sampling techniques such as CMR. Methods. In total, 41 wood mice were successfully captured, marked and released from two study sites in two different years, with weight, sex and faecal egg counts (FEC; used as a measure of the level of parasitism) recorded at every capture. Key results. In both studies, FEC was positively correlated with the capture rate of mice and the number of different traps in which an individual was caught. Conclusions. We conclude that parasitism affects the rate of capture of wood mice and has the potential to represent a significant source of heterogeneity in trapping probability. Implications. The consistent results of these two small studies suggest that wildlife point-sampling techniques may be biased by the parasitic status of the animals, which has potentially significant and far-reaching implications for wildlife population studies and disease-prevalence studies.},

pages = {541-549},
abstract = {The use of a seaweed habitat by red deer Cervus elaphus L. on the Isle of Rum, Scotland, was examined in detail. New information is provided on diet selection, timing of seaweed use relative to tides, interindividual differences in seaweed use, and sex differences in site use within the seaweed habitat ('site segregation'). Interestingly, seaweed use by adult males and females was closely correlated to that of their mothers. This implies that deer 'learn' early in life to include seaweed into their diet. Formerly, it has been suggested that male inferiority in indirect competitive ability relative to females causes site segregation in dimorphic ungulates ('indirect competition hypothesis'). The observed pattern of site segregation within the seaweed habitat was used to test the hypothesis, which predicts that males should be found at sites where they can achieve higher intake rates, but where forage quality is lower than at female sites. With respect to seaweed use, the hypothesis further predicts that segregation should be lower within the seaweed habitat than within terrestrial vegetation communities, and that males should time seaweed use earlier (relative to the tide) than females. This is because seaweed availability is more subject to tidal rhythm than to indirect competition in comparison to terrestrial habitats. Males and females used different bays, and within bays they used different fractions of seaweed. However, male-preferred sites did not yield higher intake rates and were not of lower forage quality than sites preferred by females. Moreover, segregation was not lower within the seaweed habitat than within terrestrial vegetation communities, and males did not time their seaweed use earlier relative to the tide than did females. The indirect competition hypothesis could not explain the observed pattern of site segregation. Other factors, such as sex differences in sheltering or anti-predator behaviour, or social harassment, could be responsible instead.},

abstract = {In non-territorial species, individuals can move freely and should be distributed in an ideal free manner between habitats and areas with respect to resources that influence lifetime reproductive success (LRS). Consequently, no relationship between diet quality and LRS should be expected. However, there have been no attempts to test this prediction. The present paper investigates the relationship between forage habitat use and LRS in red deer (Cervus elaphus) hinds within three neighbouring areas on the Isle of Rum which differed in their amounts of high-quality-forage habitat. Within areas, hinds move widely and have access to the same resources. We found no correlation between LRS of individual hinds and their use of high-quality-forage habitat (i.e. short Agrostis/Festuca grassland). Our analysis suggests that high hind densities on short Agrostis/Festuca grassland offset any advantages of increased access to preferred forage. These results support the hypothesis that red deer hinds are distributed in an ideal free manner with respect to the use of high-quality-forage habitat. However, hinds rarely leave areas where they are born, and the analysis suggests that constraints in changing areas hindered an ideal free distribution on a larger spatial scale. Consequently, mean LRS was not the same within the three investigated areas: one area, with a low amount of short Agrostis/Festuca grassland and a low hind density, contributed more male offspring (and more total offspring) per hind to the population than the other two areas.},

abstract = {Sex differences in habitat use (habitat segregation) are widespread in sexually dimorphic ungulates. A possible cause is that males are more sensitive to weather than females, leading to sex differences in sheltering behaviour (the 'weather sensitivity hypothesis'). However, this hypothesis has never been tested. We considered the allometric rates of net energy gain during times of cold weather,and food shortage in a model. We argue that the higher absolute heat losses relative to intake rates of larger ungulates should indeed lead to higher weather sensitivity in males than in females. Furthermore, we tested the weather sensitivity hypothesis empirically in red deer, Cervus elaphus, on the Isle of Rum, U.K. We predicted that (1) use of relatively exposed, high-quality forage habitat should be negatively influenced by bad weather; and (2) this influence should be stronger in males. We found that bad weather (strong wind, low temperature, heavy rain) in winter and spring influenced use of high-quality forage habitat negatively in all deer; that adult males responded more strongly to low temperature and strong wind than did females; and that adult males foraged on windy days at better sheltered sites than did females. Thus, the weather sensitivity hypothesis is supported both theoretically and empirically. We suggest that the weather sensitivity hypothesis ran potentially explain winter habitat segregation in a large number of ungulate species.

They are a puzzling phenomenon, particularly when females use better foraging habitats than males. It has been suggested that males, owing to their larger body size and higher forage requirements, are inferior in indirect competition to females and are forced by female grazing pressure into marginal habitats ('indirect-competition hypothesis'). This hypothesis has been widely cited and has important theoretical and practical implications. However, evidence for it is inconclusive. The present paper presents the results of the first experimental test of the indirect-competition hypothesis. We manipulated female and male numbers of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) on a large scale on the Isle of Rum, Scotland, and tested the influence of this manipulation on deer habitat use. We predicted that where female numbers were reduced, male use of preferred habitat should increase and sex differences in habitat use should decrease, while a reduction in male numbers should not have such effects. In contrast, we found that the manipulation of female and male numbers did not affect habitat use, and conclude that the indirect-competition hypothesis does not explain habitat segregation on Rum.},

In the present study, we tested the indirect competition hypothesis for site segregation of red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland, within two vegetation communities: short Agiostis/Festuca grassland and Calluna heath.

Observations on regrowth of ash Fraxinus excelsior showed that while damage inside fences was significantly reduced when compared with areas outside, the fences sometimes failed to provide adequate protection. Observations on all coppice areas fenced since 1988 revealed that the extent of canopy formation was positively related to the density of surviving stools and to the area of adjacent rides. Improvements are suggested for fence design and the siting of coppiced areas.

abstract = {The zoogeomorphological impact of burrowing animals varies in time and space as a result of the particular life history traits of the organisms involved, the patchy distribution of habitat resources, and fluctuations in population size. Such ecological complexity presents a major challenge for biogeomorphologists wishing to upscale from individuals to populations. Using a unique ecological data set for Eurasian badgers (Meles meles L.) in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, UK, we show that direct zoogeomorphological impact (soil displacement during sett excavation) is constrained by fluctuations in overall population size. Modeled digging rates for individual badgers (0.19-4.51m(3)yr(-1)) varied depending on the ecological function of the sett they are associated with, and we estimate that the whole population has displaced 304-601 +/- 72m(3) of soil during the construction of 64 setts. This represents an overall excavation rate of 6.7-19.4m(3) (6.0-17.5 t)yr(-1) in sett areas or 1.42-4.12gm(-2)yr(-1) when averaged over the whole 424ha woodland. As well as direct soil displacement, badger digging exposes material that is initially susceptible to erosion by water relative to undisturbed and litter-covered soils. Over time, setts become stabilized, representing unique landforms that persist in the landscape for decades to centuries.},

In 1991-1994, range encompassed much of the catchment, but reduced in 1995-1997 to a small area around the initial release site, when the otters were joined/replaced by natural immigrants presumed to come from a contiguous catchment. Range expanded in 1998-2000 to upper reaches of the catchment's major tributaries. 3. Fish, mainly cyprinids, were the major prey taken in 1992-1994 and 1996-1997. In 1996-1997, fish abundant near the initial release site became more prominent, in particular chub Leuciscus cephalus, and (upstream) species characteristic of the initial range decreased in importance. 4. Despite confirmed and unconfirmed sightings of females with cubs, it remains unclear whether the presence and apparent expansion of otters in the Lee catchment is the result of the reintroduction or of natural immigration/recolonization.

abstract = {Radiotelemetry was used to measure the range areas, activity patterns and time budgets of 21 adult male wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) between May 1991 and August 1992. The study investigated variation in range, total distance travelled, speed of movement and time budgets between wood mice in the nonbreeding and breeding seasons in a deciduous woodland (n = 8 and 6 respectively). We also examined habitat differences by estimating these same parameters for wood mice inhabiting maritime sand-dunes in the breeding season (n = 7). Insufficient males of an appropriate mass for radiotracking were captured to study the sand-dune mice in the nonbreeding season. Significant variation was found across both season and site. In the breeding season, in woodland, range areas were 5 times larger than during the nonbreeding season. Wood mice on the sand-dunes exploited ranges 28 times greater than their woodland counterparts. The pattern of variation in range area was parallelled by significant differences in total distances and average speeds travelled per night. Diurnal activity, c. 60 min day(-1), was frequently recorded, at both sites, but only, in the breeding season, which was attributed to the need to forage in order to maintain energy balance. The comparatively lower availability of food on the sand-dunes was considered the main factor explaining the greater range area, total distance moved, speed travelled and level of activity of animals at this site.},

abstract = {A change in population density can generate spatial and demographic effects that can have an impact on fluctuations in population Size for many years. Although the demographic effects of time lags have been incorporated into analyses of time series data, there are few detailed descriptions of the long-term demographic consequences of a change in density. We use detailed, individual-based data from a population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) from the North Block of the Isle of Rum, Scotland, to describe long-term demographic and spatial effects of a change in density. The population was released from hunting pressure in 1972. Over the following 10 years population density doubled and, since the early 1980s, has fluctuated around ecological carrying capacity. The cessation of culling led to long-term transient spatial and demographic effects that have persisted for 30 years. Different vital rates responded to the increase in density at different rates, causing long-term changes to the demographic and spatial structure of the population. These changes altered the impact of different age- and sex-specific vital rates on annual changes in population size. These changes are still ongoing, 30 years after cessation of the cull, suggesting that a change in density may generate transient dynamics that persist for several generations.},

abstract = {1. Introduced rabbits are known to have catastrophic effects on oceanic islands, either by direct destruction of the vegetative cover, or by the resulting disturbance of indigenous vertebrates. 2. Another dramatic effect, less well known, but potentially of major importance, is the hyperpredation process. This process, related to apparent competition, predicts that an introduced prey species, well adapted to high predation pressure, could induce the extinction of an indigenous prey, through the sudden increased population size of an introduced predator. In many island ecosystems, the simultaneous presence of introduced feral cats and rabbits is thus potentially a further threat for small vertebrates endemic of these islands. 3. Through a mathematical model, we tested this hypothesis, using a tri-trophic system comprising an indigenous prey (birds), an introduced prey (rabbits) and an introduced predator (cats), and we demonstrated the theoretical existence of the hyperpredation process. 4. In addition, the numerical analysis of the model allowed a quantification of this process. It shows that the conditions required for an indigenous species to cope with the hyperpredation process imply very high intrinsic growth rates and/or carrying capacity, as well as behavioural anti-predator response to the introduced predator. Since these conditions are unlikely to be met, this process is a further potential threat to most indigenous vertebrate prey. 5. Finally, our model shows that, although it can be induced by both types of adaptation together or alone, behavioural adaptations alone are more powerful in generating the hyperpredation process, than are life history traits adaptations.},

abstract = {The consumption of nontoxic, sliced carrot baits by 10 free-living European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations was investigated using Rhodamine B dye and fluorescent acetate floss fibers as bait markers. Total bait consumption was highest after 5-8 days of exposure. Increases in consumption between the 3rd and 8th days resulted from bait consumption by greater numbers of rabbits rather than increases in the amounts eaten by individuals. The data suggest that the more widely ranging individuals began consuming bait earlier than others. The average daily bait consumption/individual after 8 days of exposure varied between 216 and 346 g/kg body weight. The proportion of individuals eating bait was inversely related to the distance of their burrows from bait. There were no significant differences (P > 0.05) between sexes or among age classes in the proportions of animals consuming bait. Males ate significantly more (P < 0.001) bait than females. Adults ate significantly less (P < 0.05) bait than animals <9 months of age. It is concluded that sliced carrot bait could be used effectively as a vehicle for toxicants to control rabbit populations in Britain, provided that its presence does not substantially reduce bait consumption. A toxicant concentration considerably lower than that employed in Australia and New Zealand could be used because of the large amounts eaten by individual rabbits, thereby substantially reducing the risk to nontarget wildlife.},

abstract = {Many methods are available to gather data on wildlife population parameters, such as population abundance and density, yet few have been compared or validated. We compared the efficacy of three survey methods (live trapping, hair tubes and scats) for estimating abundance and population density of the European pine marten (Martes martes) in Galloway Forest, Scotland. We evaluated these methods by, firstly, comparing the accuracy of the population estimate derived from each method, and, secondly, comparing the financial cost of each method. Molecular analysis of samples from all three methods was used to determine sex and individual genotype. Population abundance estimates were derived from capture-recapture programme Capwire. The non-invasive methods (hair tubes and scats combined) detected 81% of known individuals, although hair tubes and scats performed poorly alone, detecting 48% and 52% of individuals, respectively. Live trapping was the individual method that detected the most individuals (77%). Hair tubes were the most expensive method, both in financial cost and personnel hours, whilst scat sampling was the cheapest method. There was a highly significant association between the sex of the animal and the total number of detections by method. The population abundance estimate from all methods combined was 32 (95% CI 31-35) and the population density estimate was 0.27 martens/km(2). This study indicates that a combined sampling approach comprising hair tubes and scats maximises the number of detections and provides a viable alternative to invasive live trapping.},

abstract = {The European pine marten (Martes martes) is a species of considerable conservation interest in Britain due to its rarity and status as a recovering native carnivore. In recent years, there has been increased application of non-invasive genetic sampling methods in population studies of Martes species. We investigated the effect of sample source (hair and faeces) in the non-invasive assessment of the distribution, population size and density of pine martens in the Fleet Basin in Galloway Forest, southwest Scotland. Fifty-two hair samples and 114 scats were collected during September and October 2014. Genetic analysis was used to identify the species, gender and individual genotype of samples. There was a significant difference in the genotyping success rate for hair samples (43 %) and scat samples (24 %). In total, 15 individual pine martens were identified; 7 males and 8 females. Capture-recapture programme Capwire produced a population size estimate of 18 individuals (95 % CI 15 to 25). Of the 15 individuals sampled, 14 (93 %) were detected from scat sampling and 5 (33 %) were detected from hair sampling. The population density estimate for a post-breeding population was 0.13 to 0.15 pine martens per square kilometre which is towards the lower limit of densities reported for pine martens elsewhere in Scotland. Data from the study highlight that future non-invasive studies aiming to determine pine marten population size and density should incorporate the collection of both hair and scat samples in order to detect as many individuals within the population as possible.},

abstract = {1. Bats are the second largest mammalian Order and important providers of ecosystem services including insect pest control, pollination and seed dispersal. Yet, the lack of basic information on their demographic rates hampers detecting changes in population trends, and thus conservation efforts. 2. The elusive life-styles, that leads to imperfect and biased detection, limits the quantity of individually based information as well as the extent to which information can be utilised to assess accurate and unbiased demographic rates. 3. We overcome the problem of imperfect and biased detection using a multilevel capture-mark-recapture framework to produce robust estimates of survival during hibernation period, and to evaluate the effect of age, sex, social group, and external weather factors on survival and capture heterogeneity in three vespertilionid species ( Myotis daubentonii, M. nattereri, and Plecotus auritus) from the same woodland community. 4. While controlling for emigration and for the species-specific roosting group structure, we show that females survive better than males in two species, and that adults survive better than juveniles in all species - these survival differences being species-specific. Only one external environmental factor ( average summer temperature) explained a substantial proportion of the between-year variation in M. daubentonii survival. 5. Our study provides, for the first time, a robust estimate of annual survival in bats. We advocate careful attention to possible sources of biases when studying survival rates in the wild, considering species-specific life-history and population-specific features. Considering these factors that influence wider community responses to environmental conditions is important for the effective conservation management of an area. (C) 2017 The Authors.

journal = {Basic and Applied Ecology},

pages = {28-36},
abstract = {The extent to which a resource (e.g. nest site, food resource) is available and utilised in the wild is of fundamental importance to the understanding of species' biology, community ecology, and for evidence-based conservation and habitat management. However, dynamics of resource use is challenging to study because it is likely determined by a complex set of (often unknown) factors and their interactions, and because of imperfect and biased detection rates (usually false absences). In this study we test for multiple drivers of summer roosting site occupancy by bats, using a rigorous statistical framework that combines multistate occupancy models with two-class heterogeneity models. Understanding the utilization of this critical resource is a pre-requisite for any successful conservation management of (often declining) bat populations. We evaluated the importance of several external and internal sources of inter-annual roost occupancy dynamics in a community of three sympatric woodland bat species: weather, roost spatial position, roost intrinsic (unmeasurable) quality, memory effect in roost use, and inter-species dynamics. We identified the existence of two classes of the roost's intrinsic quality, and showed that bats tend to re-occupy previously occupied roosts irrespective of the roost intrinsic quality (memory effect). At the landscape scale, distance from water but not from the woodland edge influenced occupancy dynamics, with roosts closer to water having higher probability of being occupied. We also identified species-specific patterns of roost occupancy, colonisation and extinction, and between species roost interchange. Our statistically powerful and flexible modelling approach can distinguish between multiple drivers of resource occupancy: measurable factors (environmental conditions and resource traits), unmeasurable (hidden or unknown) factors, previous use of the resource (memory effect) and community-level interactions. As such, it can be used to identify important areas for species (or communities), as well as to test evolutionary and ecological hypotheses concerning resource utilisation.

abstract = {Trade-offs between survival and reproduction are at the core of life-history theory, and essential to understanding the evolution of reproductive tactics as well as population dynamics and stability. Factors influencing these trade-offs are multiple and often addressed in isolation. Further problems arise as reproductive states and survival in wild populations are estimated based on imperfect and potentially biased observation processes, which might lead to flawed conclusions. In this study, we aimed at elucidating trade-offs between current reproduction (both pregnancy and lactation), survival and future reproduction, including the specific costs of first reproduction, in long-lived, income breeding small mammals, an under-studied group. We developed a novel statistical framework that encapsulates the breeding life cycle of females, and accounts for incomplete information on female pregnancy and lactation and imperfect and biased recapture rates. We applied this framework to longitudinal data on two sympatric, closely related bat species (Myotis daubentonii and M.nattereri). We revealed the existence of several, to our knowledge previously unknown, trends in survival and breeding of these closely related, sympatric species and detected remarkable differences in their age and costs of first reproduction, as well as their survival-reproduction trade-offs. Our results indicate that species with this type of life history exhibit a mixture of patterns expected for long-lived and short-lived animals, and between income and capital breeders. Thus, we call for more studies to be conducted in similar study systems, increasing our ability to fully understand the evolutionary origin and fitness effects of trade-offs and senescence.},

abstract = {The indigenous wildcat, Felis silvestris Schreber, 1775, and the introduced domestic cat, F. catus L., have been sympatric in Britain for more than 2000 years. As a result of interbreeding, any distinction between these two forms has become obscured, although a range of morphological criteria (pelage patterns, body measurements, gut lengths, skull morphometrics) and genetic techniques (immunological distances, electrophoresis, DNA hybridization) have been used previously to distinguish between them. A sample of 333 wild-living cats in Scotland was assessed for coloration and markings of pelage, standard body measurements and weights, and (for carcasses only) limb bone lengths, intestine lengths, and skull measurements. These cats were also classified as wildcat, hybrid, or domestic cat according to traditional pelage criteria. Multivariate analyses on these variables, for adult cats, failed to show any clearly distinct groups. When each of the variables was analysed separately, only the distribution of limb bone and intestine length measurements suggested the possibility that two groups might exist. Group 1 cats had short intestines and long limb bones. Group 2 consisted of cats with long intestines and short limb bones. Although the characteristics defining cats in Group 1 were similar to those traditionally associated with wildcats, they exhibited a much broader range of pelage and coloration than traditionally described. The groups exhibited a degree of geographical separation. The distribution of Group 1 cats was found to be related to certain environmental variables, namely mean annual temperature and land with poor potential for forestry and agriculture, suggesting that there may be a biological basis for the separation. The implications of these results on the identification and taxonomy of the wildcat are significant. The concept of the wildcat and the domestic cat as separate species can be challenged. The paper highlights the complexity and difficulties for conventional taxonomy when used as a means for distinguishing between a wild type and its domesticated form where there is interbreeding.},

abstract = {1. The wildcat is considered to be threatened by interbreeding with the domestic cat. As a result of interbreeding the definition of a wildcat in Scotland is contentious. Many authors consider pelage characteristics to be diagnostic, yet few data exist on sympatric cats with different pelages. 2. A study of 31 wild-living cats was conducted from 1995 to 1997 in an area associated with wildcats. Seventy-four per cent of cats caught had striped tabby pelages while 26% had other (non-tabby) phenotypes. 3. On the basis of data from eight nuclear DNA microsatellite loci there was no strong evidence of two groups, and tabby and non-tabby cats did not depart significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. 4. There were significant differences in gene frequencies and genotypes between the two pelage types. Non-tabby cats were also significantly more similar to domestic cats than tabby cats, although still noticeably differentiated from them. 5. There were potential parent-offspring and sibling-sibling relationships between and within tabby and non-tabby cats, suggesting recent interbreeding. On average, however, non-tabby cats were genetically less related to each other than tabby cats. 6. Radio-tracking revealed that non-tabby adult females had significantly larger home ranges than tabby adult females. However, for all other aspects of home range size, social organization, activity patterns and habitat use there were no significant differences between cats of different pelage type. 7. The implications of these results are that traditional approaches for attempting to distinguish wild animals in the face of interbreeding with their domestic forms are neither accurate nor effective. Instead, conservation should focus on mechanisms for dealing with groups of animals below the species level. 8. Specifically for the wildcat in Scotland, conservation should focus on protection by area. If domestic cat controls were conducted within specified areas then the potential threat posed by interbreeding would be reduced.},

Two morphological groupings (Group 1 and Group 2) have previously been proposed to explain the variation found in wild-living cats in Scotland, with Group 1 cats closest to wildcats and Group 2 cats to domestic cats. Data From the reproductive tracts of 185 wild-living cat carcasses and evidence of reproductive activity in 31 live cats were analysed in order to compare reproductive activity between the morphological groups, and in relation to seasonality and existing data on wildcats and domestic cats. For males, Group 2 cats had a greater mean relative testes size than Group 1 cats. Estimated from corpora lutea, there was a suggestion that Group 1 females showed more seasonality in oestrous than Group 2 cats. In all wild-living cats, the mean litter size was 4.3 and estimated birth dates were throughout the year, but least in winter. A high number of pseudopregnancies were recorded. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that Group 2 cats are closer to domestic cats. However, the variation observed in the sample of wild-living cats reported here, suggested that reproduction was neither strictly seasonal nor outside the range observed in some feral cat populations.},

abstract = {Since European badgers (Meles meles L.) form non-cooperative groups in parts of their geographic range, but are solitary elsewhere, their social systems have been at the centre of a debate about the evolution of group living in the Carnivora. In a recent review of models of non-cooperative sociality, Woodroffe and Macdonald (1993) presented evidence in favour of two hypotheses, which suggested that badger groups might form because either the distribution of blocks of food-rich habitat, or the economics of excavating new setts, prevented the division of group territories into individual territories. We present data upon the response of badger spatial organisation to a reduction in food-patch dispersion, brought about by the conversion of earthworm-poor arable land to earthworm-rich pasture over a 15-year period. This change in the distribution of earthworm-rich habitats was accompanied by territory fission, facilitated by the excavation of new setts. This indicates that the availability of sett sites had not constrained territory size at the start of the study. However, sett distribution did define the size and configuration of the daughter territories. We also show that variation among territories in the availability of food-rich habitats was reflected in the reproductive rates and body weights of the groups that inhabited them, although there was no detectable effect upon group size.},

abstract = {Studies on the behaviour of grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis Gmelin, 1788 and other species belonging to the same genus, suggest they exhibit dominance hierarchies among both males and females, and their mating strategy is promiscuous or polygynous. However, there is little information available on how dominance translates into reproductive success or on the levels of genetic variation or genetic substructuring within a population. To address these questions, we used multilocus DNA fingerprinting to quantify genetic diversity and estimate relatedness amongst individuals in a free-ranging population of grey squirrels. Background band-sharing values revealed a high degree of genetic diversity existed. The frequency distribution of band-sharing values between known first order relatives and presumed unrelated animals was significantly different. Estimates of relatedness between individuals were therefore based on threshold levels of genetic similarity and used as a tool to infer close kinship. Possible kinship groups were identified using the spatial distribution of the home ranges of adults and juveniles. Levels of relatedness between neighbouring adults was low with five family units identified comprised of putative parents and their offspring. Several juveniles from the single cohort revealed levels of relatedness intermediate between first order relatives and unrelated animals, suggesting possible second order relationships leg half siblings) existed. The implications of these relationships are discussed.},

abstract = {From 2001 to 2003 we radio tracked 23 Pipistrellus pipistrellus and 23 Pipistrellus pygmaeus to investigate whether there are any differences in foraging behaviour between the two cryptic species during the summer, and to consider whether any differences between these species are important for their conservation planning. There were significant differences between the two species in relation to flying time, mean maximum distances travelled from the roost, numbers of foraging bouts made and span of home ranges. The results suggest that P. pipistrellus makes more flights to a greater number of foraging locations (and possibly) feeding habitats than P. pygmaeus, although these foraging areas are likely to be closer to the roosts. This behaviour is particularly marked during lactation. In contrast, P. pygmaeus spends less time flying, makes fewer foraging bouts but travels further distances, suggesting that this species is selecting specific foraging habitats. These differences in foraging behaviour support the hypothesis that these species occupy different ecological niches, and conservation planners should be aware of these differences when considering the requirements of pipistrelles in the UK.},

abstract = {Cryptic species are similar in morphology, and make interesting subjects for relating morphological differentiation to ecological resource partitioning. Can species that are morphologically almost identical occupy different ecological niches, and hence potentially need distinct conservation planning? The discovery that the most widespread bat in Europe - the pipistrelle - comprised two cryptic species (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus) that emit echolocation calls at different frequencies provides a remarkable model system for investigating links between morphology, echolocation call design and resource partitioning. We investigated resource partitioning between the two cryptic species of sympatric pipistrelle bats by radio tracking breeding females. Habitat selection was investigated by using compositional analysis. P. pygmaeus selected riparian habitats over all other habitat types in its core foraging areas, whereas P. pipistrellus, although preferring deciduous woodland overall, was more of a generalist, spreading its foraging time in a wider range of habitats. Although morphologically Very similar, the cryptic species show quite different patterns of habitat use. Our findings suggest that large-scale differences in habitat preferences can occur between sympatric bat species that are virtually identical in flight morphology; hence morphological differences may be a weak indication of ecological differences between taxa. Conservation planning needs to take account of these differences to meet policy and legal obligations associated with these protected cryptic species. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Damage caused by badger setts is an important source of human-carnivore conflict in urban areas of the UK, yet little is known about the spatial distribution of urban badger setts or their pattern of occupation. We compared the density, spatial distribution and size of setts in four urban and two rural study areas in the UK and assessed the applicability to urban systems of distinguishing between 'main' and 'outlier' setts. In addition, we used radio-telemetry to investigate diurnal patterns of sett use in one urban area (Brighton). It was possible to distinguish between main and outlier setts in urban environments, and local sett densities were comparable in urban and rural areas. However, urban badgers used substantially fewer setts than did a nearby rural population, and they spent a smaller proportion of days in outlier setts. Social groups with larger ranges had more setts available to them and, within groups, individuals with larger ranges used more setts. Outliers appeared to serve multiple functions, including allowing efficient and safe travel to important parts of the home range. We conclude that sett densities can be high in urban habitats, suggesting significant potential for sett-related problems to arise. The fact that urban main setts can be distinguished from outliers enables management actions to be tailored accordingly. In particular, because main setts seem to represent a particularly valuable resource to urban badgers, alternatives to the closure of problem main setts need to be considered.},

abstract = {By studying the responses of different species to urbanization, it is possible to understand the impact of this type of habitat modification and to explore, more generally, the link between variations in the environment and changes in behaviour. We radio collared 17 badgers Meles meles from six social groups in a 1 km(2) urban study area in Brighton, UK, where local badger population density was high, and collected data on their ranging behaviour between 2005 and 2007. We aimed to determine how badgers adapt their behaviour to an urban environment and to assess the generality of previously reported differences in the ranging and territorial behaviour of urban and rural badgers. Analysis of habitat preferences and movement patterns suggested that garden habitat was principally used for foraging, while scrub and allotment habitats were important in allowing animals to travel from one part of their range to another. Group and individual home ranges were the smallest so far recorded for badgers (mean 100% minimum convex polygons=9.26 and 4.91 ha, respectively). Individual range size was negatively correlated with the availability of garden habitat, suggesting that the rich food resources provided by gardens enabled ranges to be small. Group ranges were mostly non-contiguous and there was no evidence of territorial scent marking; rather, activity was mainly restricted to areas in the vicinity of main setts. It is clear that badgers can adapt successfully to urban habitats and that this process affects various aspects of their behaviour. However, our high-density population of urban badgers displayed patterns of behaviour that differed not only from those of typical rural badgers, but also in some respects from those of a previously studied low-density urban population. We conclude that generalizations about the effects of urbanization must be made with caution.},

abstract = {Examples from a variety of taxa demonstrate that under certain circumstances, the exclusion or translocation of 'problem' animals is ineffective in resolving human-wildlife conflicts and may even elicit new problems elsewhere. Damage caused by badger setts (burrows) is an important source of human-wildlife conflict in the UK and is commonly managed by excluding badgers from all or part of problem setts. We used records of licences issued for the management of such problems and a novel statistical approach to assess spatiotemporal associations between problem cases in England from 2002 to 2005. We predicted that management at urban badgers' setts, and particularly exclusion of badgers from urban main setts, would give rise to subsequent problems at focal setts and in neighbouring areas. Frequencies of problems occurring at individual setts were similar in urban and rural areas. In areas neighbouring setts subjected to management action, the background frequency of problems was higher in urban than in rural areas, reflecting the occurrence of problems at a higher proportion of urban setts. The frequency of new cases arising at or in the vicinity of managed setts within a critical time period after management action was not significantly different from the background frequency of problems for any combination of land use, sett type and management approach. This finding suggests that the measures currently employed for managing problem setts do not importantly increase the likelihood of problems reoccurring in the same location or emerging nearby.},

We found a large primary peak in activity 1 h after sunset, followed by a smaller secondary peak before sunrise. Simulated part-night lighting scenarios reveal that to capture a large proportion of bat activity, streetlights should be switched off before midnight. Current proposed uses of part-night lighting are unlikely to capture natural peaks in activity for nocturnal species.},

abstract = {Bait-marking is a widely used technique for determining the territorial configuration of social groups of the European Badger (Meles meles). Applications include ecological research and applied wildlife management problems. Bait laced with indigestible plastic pellets is fed to Badger social groups, and the markers are identified in subsequent defecations. Feeding a unique colour and/or shape of pellet to each social group allows the origin of droppings to be assigned. This method is particularly suited to Badgers because they mark their territorial boundaries with communal latrines. In this paper the technique is described in detail for the first time in the scientific literature. Data from sequential visits to latrines during the survey period showed significant short-term variation in the number of marked droppings counted at individual latrines. This suggests that counting marked droppings may be of limited value in quantifying defecation rates and latrine use. However, counts of droppings at latrines could be useful if repeated over time and/or grouped into broad categories. Bait marking does provide reliable data for the estimation of territorial boundaries between Badger groups, although it is labour intensive and time-consuming, with the best results obtained by experienced fieldworkers.},

abstract = {Successful wildlife management needs to be underpinned by frequent evaluation of the problems arising and the management techniques used to resolve them. The aims of this review were: (i) to investigate spatial and temporal patterns in the occurrence and characteristics of badger-human conflict in England; and (ii) to determine which factors influence the success of management actions. Licences are required before interfering with badgers or setts, so we carried out analyses of records of applications received by Defra and data from follow-up monitoring of management actions. The number of licence applications rose significantly during the recording period (1994-2004), with an increasing proportion coming from the east of England and from urban, as opposed to rural, areas. Damage problems caused by setts were the most frequent sources of conflict in both urban and rural areas. However, the majority of rural problems related to agricultural land, whereas buildings and gardens were most affected in urban areas. A higher proportion of problems involved outlier setts in urban areas compared with rural areas. The use of one-way gates to exclude badgers from part or all of a problem sett was the commonest management action proposed by Defra Wildlife Advisers, with total sett closure more common in urban, compared with rural, areas. Follow-up monitoring revealed that the success of action varied in relation to the type of sett causing a problem, the type of management action undertaken and the land use (urban or rural) at the problem location, with total closure of an urban main sett being the least successful strategy. This review provides an assessment of current trends in conflict occurrence and will help in the development of management techniques.},

abstract = {1. The European badger (Meles meles) is implicated as a reservoir of Mycobacterium bovis (bovine TB) infection for cattle in Britain and Ireland. In the present study the spatio-temporal distribution of M. bovis infection was investigated. Analyses were carried out on data from a long-term epidemiological and ecological study of the dynamics of bovine TB in a wild population of badgers at Woodchester Park in south-west England. 2. During the 15 years of the capture-mark-recapture study (1982-96), 3316 trapping and post-mortem records were obtained from 1270 individual badgers. Annual prevalence of infection based on positive serological and bacterial tests varies between 10.3% and 17.7% of the population. 3. Infection was aggregated in social groups in the west of the study area, confirming the findings of previous studies. However, temporal trends in disease were not synchronized amongst neighbouring groups, suggesting low rates of disease transfer between them. 4. There was significant serial correlation in the disease status within groups over time, suggesting that infection persists for many years in some social groups. The presence of infectious adult female badgers in groups was associated with new infections, and provides further evidence for their importance in the maintenance of infection within groups. However, no statistically significant correlations were detected between the demographic characteristics of social groups and group infection status. 5. The distribution of disease reflects stable persistent foci of infection in the badger population, with limited evidence of transfer between social groups. The accurate identification of stable foci of infection would allow a range of management strategies for the control of bovine TB to be efficiently targeted in such populations. However, the extent to which this pattern of infection is representative of low-density and disturbed badger populations is unknown.},

abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis in cattle is a significant problem in the UK where the incidence of TB infected herds has continued to rise in recent years. The European badger, Meles meles, has been implicated in the maintenance and transmission of Mycobacterium bovis to cattle, and has been the subject of an official policy of lethal control. Since 1975 a longitudinal study of the ecology and TB status of a naturally infected free-living population of badgers has been conducted in Gloucestershire, England. Population dynamics and social organisation are studied using live trapping, radio-tracking and bait marking techniques, whilst the blood and excretory products of marked individuals are routinely screened for evidence of M. bovis infection. Field data have been incorporated into a simulation model that produces realistic levels of TB prevalence in a badger population. The model provides predictions of the likely outcome of different management regimes that may be tested by field experiments. Research is focused on the factors that may be important in the transmission of TB amongst badgers and between badgers and cattle. The density of badgers in the study area has steadily increased throughout the study but bears no linear relationship with the prevalence of TB infection. Clearly other factors apart from host density may be important determinants of TB infection in badger populations. The extent to which spatial and temporal changes in the spread of disease are affected by badger social structure, movement and variations in susceptibility to infection, is the subject of continuing research. At present badgers are unlikely to constitute a reservoir of TB infection to cattle in mainland Europe. One possible reason is that hunting pressure and endemic rabies may have depressed badger populations below the threshold density required for the maintenance of M, bovis.},

abstract = {In the U.K., Eurasian badgers often live in social groups and defend a collective territory. Aggressive encounters between badgers may lead to bite wounds, which can be severe and may be a potential route of disease transmission. Using data obtained over a 5-year period, we compared patterns of bite wounding in three badger populations of differing population density and culling history in southwest and southern England. Data from 4312 live-trapping events were analysed. Bite wounds were more likely in adult badgers than in cubs, and in males than in females. Males were also more likely to have multiple bites. Bite wounding varied seasonally, peaking during December to February. Most bite wounds in adult males were on the rump, whereas females and cubs were more likely to have been bitten on the head. Bite wounds were more likely in badgers in poor body condition. The incidence of bite wounds was not related to study site or population density, but varied significantly between years. Complex interactive effects suggested that patterns of bite wounding may vary over time and at a local scale. Although culling-induced social perturbation was not associated with higher levels of bite wounding, there was evidence that female badgers endured higher rates of biting during recolonization.

abstract = {Eurasian badgers Meles meles habitually deposit droppings and other scent marks at latrines, which may be associated with territorial defence, and communicate information related to group and individual identity and status, and food resources. Understanding patterns of latrine distribution contributes to our understanding of badger social behaviour, and may be relevant to managing the risks of transmission of bovine tuberculosis from badgers to cattle. We investigated the distribution of badger latrines relative to habitat composition in a high-density badger population occupying a 7 km(2) area of diverse landscape in south-west England. Results indicated that the frequency and density of badger latrines varied according to land use, with woodland and linear landscape features (particularly hedges and stone walls) being positively selected. The number of latrines decreased significantly with distance from linear features. Grassland was negatively selected given its availability, but contained the highest number of latrines. The tendency for latrines to be associated with particular habitat types covaried spatially across the study area. We present a habitat selection probability function, based on the output of our analyses, to allow comparison of observed versus expected latrine counts per habitat type at different sites. Habitat manipulation on farmland may offer opportunities to manage exposure of cattle to badger latrines. However, our analyses indicate that other factors (perhaps demographic or environmental) may also exert a substantial local influence on latrine location.},

abstract = {Populations of the same species often face different selection pressures and, increasingly, the demography of populations within a species has been shown to be highly variable. Knowledge of such intraspecific differences has implications for substituting demographic data, a practice that is often necessary for population modelling due to missing parameters. The red fox Vulpes vulpes, a widely-studied, widespread and economically important species, offers an opportunity to consider the degree of intraspecific variability in the demography of a carnivore and to test the consequences of interpopulation data substitution. We use published life history data to review the extent and quality of demographic data for fox populations. Using demographic descriptors, matrix models, and perturbation analyses, we identify important demographic properties and classify interpopulation variation along the fastslow continuum. We also illustrate the consequences of data substitution in demographic models. Data quality varies substantially between reviewed studies. Sufficient data exist to model the demography of eight of 56 study populations. Modelled populations have a tendency towards positive population growth, with survival and fecundity of the youngest age class contributing most to that growth. Metrics point to strategies ranging from medium to fast life histories. While broad demographic similarities exist among fox populations, our results imply considerable demographic variation between populations. We show that significant differences in model outcomes based on substituted data are dependent on the parameter replaced, and that geographic proximity does not imply demographic similarity. Superficially, the red fox appears to have been well studied, yet there are remarkably few usable demographic data from much of its range. Despite 70 years of published studies, we were unable to examine the effects on demographic parameters of harvesting regimes, density and weather. We propose improvements to enhance the value of demographic data, both for foxes and for other species.},

We also assessed the role of indirect transmission. Contrary to assumptions typical of epidemiological models, mange dynamics are better explained by frequency-dependent disease transmission than by density-dependent transmission in this canid. We found no support for indirect transmission. We present the first estimates of R-0 and age-specific transmission coefficients for mange in foxes. These parameters are important for managing this poorly understood but highly contagious and economically damaging disease.},

abstract = {This paper compares three methods for measuring the relative incidence of rabbits (the extent to which different areas are used by rabbits). Each method was used to produce an index of rabbit incidence and these indices used to rank sites on grassy fields in set-aside. Two of the methods are based on widely used techniques; faecal pellet counts and above-ground sight counts. The third method is a new one based on the number of carrot slices consumed by rabbits per unit area of land. I found that all three indices produced similar rankings of the sites but that the carrot slice consumption index was considerably less time consuming than the pellet index and gave more consistent results than the sight-count index. The usefulness and limitations of the three methods are discussed.},

abstract = {Sika Cervus nippon are native to Japan and East Asia but are now naturalized in many parks of the world, including Britain. In contrast to the substantial body of research on the extent of hybridization between sika and red deer Cervus elaphus in Scottish populations, there has been little genetic analysis of the English populations of sika. Sika in England still have a patchy and discontinuous distribution; populations are thus still genetically isolated and may be expected to show higher variability in genetic type. The current paper uses DNA-based techniques to explore the genetic composition of sika in the New Forest (Hampshire) and that of sika from the largest population in England, in the Purbeck region (Dorset). The study aims were to determine whether New Forest sika show signs of recent interbreeding with New Forest red deer populations, whether New Forest sika are genetically distinct from Purbeck sika, and whether New Forest and Purbeck sika show evidence of past hybridization or whether they are pure (non-hybrid) strains. Microsatellite analysis was used to compare the genetic profiles of individual deer. Results showed that sika and red deer in the New Forest were genetically distinct, indicating that there is no large-scale in situ hybridization occurring between these feral populations. In terms of overall genetic composition, there was no significant difference between the sika in the New Forest and Purbeck. However, a more detailed analysis found that New Forest sika showed a lower level of introgression with red deer compared with the Purbeck sika. We conclude that, overall, the New Forest sika deer do appear to be more genetically pure bred than the Purbeck sika.},

They foraged singly on exposed pasture with a random distribution of distances from cover, and yet they suffered a significant mortality, due to predation by badgers (Meles meles).

A low density population of hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus was artificially increased in numbers while simultaneously a high density population was reduced. Subsequent dispersal, mortality and natality were monitored in complete censuses of the total populations, and compared to a control population of transplanted hedgehogs at unchanged density. Predation on hedgehogs was principally by badgers Meles meles which forage for substantially similar foods to hedgehogs, and was significantly higher in the expanded population during the first 2 wk after transplant than in the control, which nevertheless suffered a high overall mortality. Dispersal of male hedgehogs in particular from the expanded population contributed to reducing the density close to its original level within 1 month of transplant, after which the population remained relatively stable for a further 2 months of monitoring. Surviving hedgehogs at this site maintained closer proximity to residential buildings. which were avoided by badgers, than those at the control site, rates of weight gain by males were also superior to those in the control population. The artificially reduced population in an urban area containing no badgers was partially replenished within 1 month. through a decreased loss rate and an increased gain rate, initially of adults and later in the year of juveniles born after the transplant. The hedgehogs here showed seasonal variation in dispersion between fields, which were associated with the breeding cycle and the distribution of earthworm prey. Hedgehogs utilized mown grass fields in relation to the availability of earthworms Lumbricus spp., which was itself dependent on the age of fields. The study demonstrates that predation can influence the abundance of hedgehogs as well as their distribution in a heterogeneous environment. Residential and urban patches of land appear to represent a niche largely free from badger activity, where hedgehog populations maintain a high equilibrium density despite predation by domestic dogs which can contribute to a rapid population turn-over.},

The composition of the diet varied monthly and seasonally. Small mammals peaked in late winter, lagomorphs in April, and birds in June; fruits constituted a large proportion of the diet in autumn. Occurrence in feces of fruits, Passeriformes, Coleoptera, and invertebrate larvae correlated strongly with seasonal variations in indices of the abundance of these prey, suggesting that they were taken in proportion to their availability. Columbiformes, lagomorphs, and rodents showed no such direct relationship, indicating that foxes selected for or against these foods in some way not directly related to their abundances as censused.},

City and suburban foxes had comparable diets and ranges of the same order of magnitude; the mobility of city foxes was associated with social instability due to a higher turnover of the population and a lower proportion of barren vixens.

abstract = {1. We report a field experiment designed to explore the responses by hedgehogs to novel and unfavourable terrain, which they encounter when dispersing between fragmented local populations in farmland. We identified four replicate sites as unused by hedgehogs, but lying between existing populations and containing locally abundant food. At each site, we released six hedgehogs from distant sources at 2-day intervals and monitored their subsequent dispersals over 20 days by radio-tracking. We compared movement trajectories under this treatment to those of 29 hedgehogs released at two sites known to support abundant hedgehogs. A third treatment comprised 20 unmanipulated hedgehogs at three sites. We estimated habitat use and proximity to habitats by comparing each observed trajectory to simulated random walks of equal length. We sought differences between treatments in movement and habitat use from nested analysis of variance. 2, No two trajectories of any translocated hedgehogs followed the same route; most involved little change in body weight, and took the animal into or through existing populations. Hedgehogs moved substantially further and faster on average from the unfavourable than from the favourable sites. They showed a significantly stronger attraction to habitat edges, which therefore acted as corridors, and a significant proportion of them stayed closer to roads and to urban habitat than random expectation. Habitat preferences also shifted significantly towards urban and away from arable areas. Six were predated, and two killed by road traffic. At least three returned to their release point, with P < 0.05 of this occurring by chance. 3, In this region, natural dispersals between populations up to 4 km apart are rare events. We have shown, however, that hedgehogs are capable of travelling distances of up to 3.8 km from a release point, and up to 9.9 km in total, compared to an average home range span of 0.8 km, and it appears that none of the local populations in the study area are out of reach of neighbours.},

journal = {Oikos},

abstract = {Much discussion of the determinants of carnivore sociality has been dogged by its reliance on largely untestable hypotheses. Here we employ spatial analysis of published data on badger (Meles meles) setts and latrine sites from five study localities in Britain to test the idea that den locations can determine territory shape and size. Territorial boundary points were identified from latrines shared between two or more main setts. These were found to lie in close proximity to the hypothetical borders of a fixed-territory model constructed from Dirichlet tessellations around main setts. At three localities the fit was better than chance expectation, given by points scattered at random and repelled from main setts. These results suggest a functional interpretation of territorial behaviour, in terms of maximizing reproductive success by defending an established breeding den, which the conventional models of central-place foraging do not encompass. A test of the Dirichlet borders against a model of differential expansion suggested that occupants of some main setts could expand one or more borders to the detriment of neighbouring territories, probably in response to variations in food availability around the given den sites. The implications of these results are that (1) by defining territory size, suitable den sites for breeding and overwintering may impose an upper limit on the density of badger social units, and (2) the distribution of main setts may therefore influence the size of group that can be accommodated in the resulting territory. The question of why badgers are sociable therefore finds a reply with unexpected significance given to the location of dens. We suggest the model might be appropriate to other vertebrates for which an established den or nest site could represent a key resource to be costed in an energy currency in the animal's defence budget.},

abstract = {Red foxes thrive in towns and cities, where much of their food is deliberately provided by humans. We studied fox foraging behavior using camera traps in residential gardens where householders regularly fed foxes. Predictable feeding patterns attracted foxes to gardens, females were more efficient foragers than males, and dominant foxes enjoyed priority access to food, so that subordinates had to adopt compensatory strategies. Understanding how foxes exploit resources may help address conflicts in urban areas. In patchy environments, foragers adopt different strategies to acquire resources depending on their internal state and external physical and social environment: this has important fitness consequences. Linking individual variation in patch use to tangible characteristics is key to understand many higher-level ecological processes. We studied patch use by red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in the city of Bristol, UK. We placed camera traps in gardens where householders provisioned foxes (patches) to investigate whether 1) foxes discriminated between patches based on food availability, quantified as provisioning frequency (predictability) and the energy value of provisioned food; and 2) individual patch use varied with dominance, gender, and season. Increased frequency of provisioning encouraged more foxes to visit and to stay longer in patches. All foxes visited the most predictable patches first each day, but females were more selective and generally more efficient foragers than males. Females increased foraging effort during cub rearing, whereas males reduced patch use in the dispersal and mating season. Dominants and subordinates shared patches spatiotemporally, possibly facilitated by relatedness and familiarity between group members. However, dominants visited more food patches on their territory, spent more time in predictable patches and fed earlier than subordinates. Subordinates may compensate for competition by visiting patches of lower quality or outside their territory, which is inefficient and risky. Our results demonstrate gender differences in behavioral motivation, show how subordinates forego foraging efficiency to mitigate intra-group competition and reveal how human provisioning influences fox space use in urban areas.},

abstract = {Urban areas have both positive and negative influences on wildlife. For terrestrial mammals, one of the principal problems is the risk associated with moving through the environment while foraging. We examined nocturnal patterns of movement of urban-dwelling hedgehogs in relation to (1) the risks posed by predators and motor vehicles and (2) nightly weather patterns. Hedgehogs preferentially utilized the gardens of semidetached and terraced houses. However, females, but not males, avoided the larger back gardens of detached houses, which contain more of the habitat features selected by badgers. This difference in the avoidance of predation risk is probably associated with sex differences in breeding behaviour. Differences in nightly movement patterns were consistent with strategies associated with mating behaviour and the accumulation of fat reserves for hibernation. Hedgehogs also differed in behaviour associated with the risks posed by humans; they avoided actively foraging near roads and road verges, but did not avoid crossing roads per se. They were, however, significantly more active after midnight when there was a marked reduction in vehicle and foot traffic. In particular, responses to increased temperature, which is associated with increased abundance of invertebrate prey, were only observed after midnight. This variation in the timing of bouts of activity would reduce the risks associated with human activities. There were also profound differences in both area ranged and activity between years which warrant further investigation. (C) 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

The mean number of activity bouts per night was 3.5, each lasting for an average of 148 minutes. The mean distance travelled between fixes during each bout of activity was 3.8 km, and per night was 14.2 km. An average of 3.3 (SE = 1.8, range = 1-7, n = 12) night roosts were used per bat. Those individuals which continued roosting within the estate (n = 13) occupied a group foraging range covering approximately 1,175 ha with a 6.3 km range span (100% minimum convex polygon). The corresponding areas using the 95% Kernel isopleth and 95% Dirichlet tessellation enclosed approximately 539 ha and 1,553 ha, respectively. The maximum distance a bat was tracked from the roost of capture was 4.6 km, although the mean (n = 15) was much lower (2.2 km). A mean of 42% of the radio-tracking fixes from bats with at least one whole night of data were associated with night roosting, and of those, 56% were from the boiler room of a residential property within Sherborne village (used by 12 of the 15 bats). Therefore a range of suitable night roosts (i.e. sheltered locations adjacent to foraging areas) should be available throughout the foraging range (a minimum of 3 km from the roost) of a R. hipposideros colony. Night roosts on the edge of the home range, and warm night roosts are especially important.},

abstract = {The lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) is a widespread but rare bat in central and southern Europe, having undergone a dramatic population decline in the 1950s and 1960s. However, an internationally significant population has persisted in the United Kingdom, which now appears to be increasing. The present study extends previous radio-tracking studies on R. hipposideros to confirm and extend species-specific habitat management recommendations. It is also the first to radio-track adult males in lowland England. Thirteen lesser horseshoe bats (eight males and five females, from two maternity roosts) were radio-tracked within and around the National Trust Sherborne Park Estate, Gloucestershire (UK), between June and October 2003. A total of 2599 fixes were obtained from active bats, classified as emergence circling (2.7%), commuting (10.3%), foraging (85.2%) and return circling (1.8%). Although commuting bats were mainly recorded along the edges of fields near to hedgerows or woodlands, more open commuting routes were also identified. The longest of these (used by a single bat) was in excess of 200 m through long-established open parkland during the darkest period of the night. Shorter distances (typically 30-100 m) were also flown between mature parkland trees. It is also notable that, immediately after emergence, a significant number of bats tracked from both maternity roosts crossed low over an unlit narrow two-lane country road. Habitat selection, assessed using compositional analysis based on the radio-tracking data, identified a preference for woodland habitats above all others, particularly broadleaf woodland. Wet broadleaf woodland was used for foraging by five of the 13 tracked bats. Parkland, grazed grassland and un-grazed grassland were also selected. Arable land was the least selected. This is the first study in which compositional analysis has revealed a preference for grazed over un-grazed grassland. Grazed grassland was also selected above parkland (only some of which was grazed), suggesting that the presence of cattle may be more important than mature parkland trees. Low sample sizes prohibited the use of sex-specific compositional analyses. However, it was still notable that when comparing the sexes, females showed an increased preference for woodland and a decreased preference for grassland. It is apparent from the present study that lesser horseshoe bats are flexible in their use of foraging habitat. They are able to forage within habitats other than woodland (such as scrub and isolated trees), and cross open gaps to reach these areas. However, these foraging situations are likely to be sub-optimal. Landscape management around lesser horseshoe maternity colonies should focus on optimal foraging habitats. These comprise linear landscape elements (such as hedges, tree-lines, rivers and woodland edges), woodland, and grazed parkland containing mature trees. Additionally, future conservation studies should consider both sexes, due to the possibility that sex-specific differences in habitat use exist.},

Bats used treelines for both commuting and foraging, but flew closer to treelines when commuting, than when foraging. More insects Were caught, and more pipistrelle feeding attempts were recorded close to treelines than further away. The relationship between the number and type of landscape elements leading to and surrounding ponds, and the use pipistrelle and Daubenton's (Myolis daubentonii) bats make of such ponds, was similarly investigated. Bats preferred to commute to ponds along, woodland edges and streams, and not along hedgerows. More bat activity was recorded over ponds that had little overhanging and surrounding vegetation in comparison to ponds that had more, and over large wide ponds in comparison to small narrow ones. The extent to which pipistrelle and Daubenton's bats' use of river corridors extends beyond the water body was also investigated. Bat activity decreased with increasing distance from rivers, up to a distance of 70 m. River sites which were wooded on both sides attracted more bat activity for a longer duration than sites which had no trees on either side. Pipistrelles made use of the wider river corridor whereas Daubenton's bats restricted their activity almost exclusively to the water body.},

Social calls were unaffected by weather variables, whereas orientation calls and feeding buzzes were both significantly affected by cloud and temperature conditions. The number of emissions of each call type was significantly different between sites, indicating that the bats used different sites for different activities. Significant positive correlations between all three combinations of call types occurred only during the middle of the night, corresponding with the nadir of flying insects. This suggests that bats were engaged in activities other than feeding at this time, such as territory protection or mate attraction.},

pages = {349-358},
abstract = {Although the importance of cattle grazed pasture to foraging bats has already been well documented, the relative importance of cattle dung compared with the cattle themselves is largely unknown. This was investigated by comparing two adjacent fields: a current and a recent area of organic cattle-grazed pasture in England. The cattle were exchanged between fields during each of two separate observation periods in June and July 2005, one of eight evenings and the other of ten. Hand-held detectors were used to record time-expanded bat passes simultaneously from comparable positions within each field for 150 minutes after sunset. In addition, two separate observation periods (one of three evenings and the other of four) was used to investigate bat activity over and away from cattle within the same field. In general, bat activity was statistically greater within the field containing cattle than in the field without cattle (paired 1-test, t(21)= 3.97, P < 0.001). Within the field containing cattle, bat activity was greater over cows than away from them (paired 1-test, t(6) = 2.48, P < 0.05). It is therefore suggested that cattle, rather than dung are the primary attractant for foraging bats. Specifically, the difference in bat activity between the fields with and without cattle was statistically significant for Eptesicus serotinus (paired 1-test, t(21) = 4.14, P < 0.001), Pipistrellus pipistrellus (paired t-test, t(21) = 3.23, P < 0.01) and Myotis (Dunn's test, Z = 2.99, P < 0.01) bats. Management recommendations include keeping cattle within bat foraging areas, minimizing the use of anthelminthic avermectin-based drugs for cattle, and maintaining woodland/trees within and around cattle-grazed pasture.},

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss are widely recognized as major threats to biodiversity on a regional as well as on a global scale. To restrict its effects, ecological networks such as the trans-European network NATURA2000 are being developed based on the assumption that structural connections between habitat fragments lead to increased exchange through dispersal and a higher viability of (meta)populations. However, there is a great need for techniques that translate these networks and/or structural characteristics of landscapes into functional connectivity for specific organisms. Least-cost analysis has the capacities to fulfill these needs, but has never been validated against actual observations of dispersal paths. Here we present a method to validate the results of a least-cost analysis by comparing realized movement paths of hedgehogs in unfamiliar areas, obtained by radiotracking, with statistics on landscape-wide distribution of cost values. The degree of correspondence between empirical dispersal paths and the output of a least-cost analysis can be visualized and quantified, and least-cost scenarios can be statistically compared. We show that hedgehogs moved along paths with significantly lower cost values than the average landscape, implying that they took better than random routes, but performance was relatively poor. We attribute this to the relatively generalistic habitat use of the model species and the rather homogeneous landscapes. We conclude that this approach can be useful for further validation of the least-cost model and allows a direct comparison of model performance among different taxa and/or landscapes.

While we found no differences in habitat or altitude usage between the two species, both showed a sharp decline in activity with small increases in altitude within all habitats. This decline was steepest in deciduous and conifer woodland, and more gradual in arable land and heath-land. Activity also declined more quickly with increasing altitude in the centre of habitats compared with the edge, and where water was present compared with where water was absent. We suggest that altitude may limit distribution independent of habitat, and thus is an important factor to take into account, in combination with habitat, when designing mammalian conservation strategies.},

The males had longer total ranges than the female. The range of the larger male almost completely overlapped with that of the female, but the range of the smaller male was mainly separate from that of the female. The ranges of the 2 males only partially overlapped, with the larger male having the greatest total range, nightly range and rate of travel, and the lowest tendency to revisit areas during the night. The smaller male was relatively sedentary, using two separate core areas, whereas the other 2 otters had single core areas and frequently patrolled their total ranges. As the larger male was sexually active, but the smaller one did not appear to be, it was argued that the need to search for mates could explain some of these differences in spatial patterns. All 3 otters used tributaries more than expected based on the areas within their total ranges. This may be because riparian margins were used in greater proportion than central areas of the channel width.},

Between 1987 and 1990 the patterns of habitat use by five otters from river catchments in north-east Scotland were examined by using radio-telemetry. The main habitat variables analysed were channel width, substrate size, riparian vegetation, proximity to roads and buildings, and the coverage of surrounding vegetation and land use. All of the otters spent more of their time in relatively wide sections of river or stream, with high boulder cover and many riparian trees. However, when use was calculated as the time spent per unit area of water, narrow, gravelly streams were selected by most animals. Some of the habitat features traditionally thought to influence otter movements (e.g. riparian vegetation, land use) did not show the predicted effects. The conservation implications of these observations are discussed.},

abstract = {We investigated the population genetics of seven maternity roosts of Bechstein's bats widely distributed across the south of England. Across all of the populations sampled, two mitochondrial DNA microsatellite loci were fixed for single haplotypes. Genetic diversity across eight nuclear microsatellite loci was similar in all seven populations, with a mean He of 0.727. However, six of the populations showed substantial homozygote excess, with F (IS) estimates greater than zero, indicative of recent inbreeding. Bottleneck tests also implied that six of the populations have experienced recent declines. Genetic differentiation among the populations was low, with a mean intersite F (ST) estimate of 0.041. There was no significant isolation by distance using allele frequency-based criteria (F (ST) and genetic distances), however, a weak correlation was found using the allele size-based R (ST) criterion. Assignment tests were unable to distinguish the seven sampling sites as distinct clusters. Mean intra-roost relatedness (r) was 0.079, indicative of recent inbreeding relative to German populations. All but one of the bats had one or more half or full siblings in its maternity roost. In addition, family relationships of individuals within a colony were significantly commoner than family relationships among four proximal roosts < 8 km apart. The results are discussed in the context of conservation requirements for this rare British bat.},

Females of both species emerged progressively later as pregnancy advanced, perhaps because of decreased flight performance, and earlier as lactation proceeded. probably because of increased energy demands and low reserves. Bats under energetic stress, due to persistent low ambient temperatures during pregnancy, or when body reserves were tow, emerged relatively early, and hence appeared to take higher risks, than other bats. Young bats emerged much later than the adults at first. but progressively earlier as their night skills improved. Lesser horseshoe bats emerged later at exposed roost exits than in more protected situations. The results largely corroborate the hypothesis that emergence time, and therefore feeding performance, of insectivorous bats is constrained at bright light conditions, possibly by predation risk (from birds), and modified by energetic considerations.},

abstract = {1. Moles are perceived as pests of farms, gardens, sports fields and nature reserves, mainly because they form molehills. The danger and inhumaneness of current methods of mole control (e.g. poisoning with strychnine or the use of mole traps) means that non-lethal methods are sought. We examined the possibility of controlling molehill distribution by using management procedures that alter the availability of earthworms, the principal food of moles. 2. The abundance of molehills and earthworms was monitored over 2 years in an acid grassland where pesticide (with and without insecticides and molluscicides), grazing (continuous grazing by rabbits vs. hay meadow), soil pH (with and without lime), herbicide (with and without herb- and grass-specific herbicides) and fertilizer (N, P, K, Mg) treatments were imposed. 3, In the experimental area of 4608 m(2), a total of 1062 molehills formed, each with an average area of 0.14 m(2); a disturbance rate equivalent to 3.2% of the soil surface over 2 years. Peak molehill production occurred in spring and autumn, with few molehills formed at other times of the year. 4. Molehill production in grazed areas was one-third that of hay meadows. Half as many molehills formed in unlimed as limed plots. Significantly fewer molehills formed in areas where grass species were removed (herb-rich) than areas where no species were removed. Insecticide, molluscicide and fertilizer application had no significant effect on molehill production. 5. The treatments that had fewer molehills also had less earthworms, indicating that molehill production was decreased, indirectly, through the treatments reducing food availability. 6. Reducing the number of molehills through management procedures that decrease earthworm availability offers an alternative to lethal control of moles. This could be achieved by allowing (or encouraging) soil pH to fall (e.g. withholding lime application; through the use of acidifying nitrogen-fertilizers), by creating herb-rich swards or by preventing plant biomass from accumulating for long periods. These methods will be more applicable to gardens, sports fields and nature reserves than to farms, where conflicts with normal farming practices would make them difficult to implement.},

The emphasis on wildlife incident reports and paraquat is in response to the perception that it may present a risk to hares. The possibility for early incidents of European Brown Hare Syndrome (EBHS) being misdiagnosed as paraquat incidents are also considered. The long-term decline in the hare population throughout Europe is widely believed to be due to changes in farmland management practices, resulting in the loss of crop/landscape diversity which affects nutrition. Predation and disease may lead to additional high mortality but probably do not influence the long-term population trend. The decline in the hare population in England, as in Europe, started prior to the widespread introduction of paraquat. Wildlife incident schemes in the UK (WIIS) and France (SAGIR) confirm there have been very few hare deaths caused by paraquat. Research indicates that free living hares are likely to be deterred from foraging paraquat sprayed vegetation after an initial exposure. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper examines public attitudes to badger culling in rural Wales, the reasons why culling is rejected and/or accepted and the level of trust the public place in different organisations responsible for badger culling. Variations in public attitudes between areas of differing degrees of rurality and disease incidence are analysed. Results indicate moderate levels of support for badger culling, but respondents do not believe the current scientific evidence on the effectiveness of a cull is acceptable. Respondents in rural fringe areas and low disease incidence are more likely to favour badger vaccination. The results have implications for future policy and methods of communicating wildlife control policies to the public.},

abstract = {1. One of the key threats to bats in Britain is loss of suitable roost sites, but little is known about roost requirements for most species. 2. Roost selection in the brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus was demonstrated by comparison of buildings used as summer roosts in north-east Scotland with (i) random buildings in the same area, and (ii) a set of adjacent houses located in the same habitat. 3. Buildings containing roosts were situated closer to woodland and water relative to the random houses, and also had a greater area of woodland within a radius of 0.5 km, but not at distances beyond this. This suggests that feeding habitat in the vicinity of the roost is important for roost selection. 4. When compared with adjacent houses, roosts were older, and had roof spaces divided into more compartments, which were more likely to be fully lined with rough wooden planking. 5. The temperatures inside summer roosts (mean 17.9 degrees C) were significantly warmer than those from random and adjacent houses (mean 16.7 degrees C). 6. These results suggest that P. auritus is selective of its roosts, relative to the houses available. 7. The selection of specific types of roosts by P. auritus has implications for the management advice provided when roosts are threatened, and conservation actions should focus on efforts to avert significant change to, or destruction of, roost sites or the woodland in their vicinity.},

abstract = {Brown long-eared bats Plecotus auritus occupying 30 summer roosts in north-east Scotland were studied over 15 years. During this time 1365 bats were ringed, and a further 720 recaptures were made. Individual bats showed a high degree of roost fidelity, returning to one main roost site; < 1% of recaptured bats had moved among roost sites, and all recorded movements (n = 5) were < 300 m. Adults of both sexes were loyal to the roost sites at which they were first captured, indicating long-term use of roosts. At least some juveniles (n = 32) of both sexes returned to the natal roost. Mark-recapture estimates indicated that colonies of this species were substantially larger (c. 30-50 individuals) than assumed in previous studies. Plecotus auritus differs from most other temperate zone, vespertilionid species in that there was no evidence of sexual segregation during summer, with males present in all colonies throughout the period of occupancy. Population structure in summer seems to be consistent with a metapopulation model, with discrete sub-populations showing minimal interchange. The group size, colony composition and population structure described in this species may be associated with the wing shape (particularly aspect ratio) and foraging behaviour of P. auritus. It is postulated that relative motility, linked to wing structure, may affect the distribution of individuals, and may have implications for the genetic structure of this species. Correlations between aspect ratio and both colony size and migratory behaviour, across British bat species, indicate that wing shape could be an important factor contributing to patterns of social behaviour and genetic structuring in bats.},

The proportion of bats recaptured did not differ between the test and control groups, which suggests that these procedures had little or no effect on the long-term survival of this species, over and above any effect of the initial capture and handling.},

abstract = {Arsenic can be highly toxic to mammals but there is relatively little information on its transfer to and uptake by free-living small mammals. The aim of this study was to determine whether intake and accumulation of arsenic by wild rodents living in arsenic-contaminated habitats reflected environmental levels of contamination and varied between species, sexes and age classes. Arsenic concentrations were measured in soil, litter, wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) from six sites which varied in the extent to which they were contaminated. Arsenic residues on the most contaminated sites were three and two orders of magnitude above background in soil and litter, respectively. Arsenic concentrations in the stomach contents, liver, kidney and whole body of small mammals reflected inter-site differences in environmental contamination. Wood mice and bank voles sn the same sites had similar concentrations of arsenic in their stomach contents and accumulated comparable residues in the liver, kidney and whole body. Female bank voles, but not wood mice, had significantly higher stomach content and liver arsenic concentrations than males. Arsenic concentration in the stomach contents and body tissues did not vary with age class. The bioaccumulation factor (ratio of arsenic concentration in whole body to that in the diet) in wood mice was not significantly different to that in bank voles and was 0.69 for the two species combined, indicating that arsenic was not bioconcentrated in these rodents. Overall, this study has demonstrated that adult and juvenile wood mice and bank voles are exposed to and accumulate similar amounts of arsenic on arsenic-contaminated mine sites and that the extent of accumulation depends upon the level of habitat contamination.

abstract = {Arsenic is accumulated by free-living small mammals, but there is little information on the resultant concentrations in different tissues other than liver and kidney. Such information is important because the severity of toxicological effects may be related to the amount of arsenic accumulated in specific organs, and the availability of arsenic to predators is, in part, dependent on which tissues accumulate arsenic. The objective of this study was to quantify the arsenic concentrations and the percentage of the total body burden (%TBB) accumulated in different body tissues of free-living small mammals and to determine how these factors varied with severity of habitat contamination. Arsenic concentrations were measured in various tissues of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) from a range of arsenic-contaminated sites in southwest Britain. Arsenic concentrations in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (including contents), liver, kidneys, spleen, lung, femur, and fur of both species varied significantly between sites and were higher in mice and voles from heavily contaminated areas. Heart and brain arsenic concentrations did not vary with degree of environmental contamination. The GI tract and excised carcass contained roughly equal amounts of arsenic and, in sum, comprised 75-85% of the TBB on uncontaminated sites and 90-99% on contaminated sites. Although the excised carcass contains about half of the TBB, its importance in food-chain transfer of arsenic to predators may depend on the bioavailability of arsenic sequestered in fur. In contrast, the GI tract and its contents, provided that it is consumed, will always be a major transfer pathway for arsenic to predators, regardless of the severity of habitat contamination.},

journal = {Journal of Applied Ecology},
volume = {43},

pages = {499-505},
abstract = {1. The British uplands are internationally important for their unique plant and bird communities. They have considerable economic, nature conservation, landscape, aesthetic and tourism-related value and as a result are under a variety of different pressures, most notably from sheep farming, shooting interests, commercial forestry and conservation interests. 2. In order to optimize biodiversity in the uplands, the challenge is to find how to balance the different land-use pressures. One key upland species that is potentially affected by livestock grazing, and is of considerable interest to both foresters and nature conservationists, is the field vole Microtus agrestis. Relaxation of livestock grazing can result in an increase in vole numbers. This in turn could have both positive and negative implications for biodiversity as (i) field voles are a major source of prey for other species and (ii) they are a cause of damage to newly planted trees and potentially damaging in areas of native woodland regeneration. 3. A replicated, randomized block experiment, consisting of six replicates of four livestock grazing treatments, was established in 2003 (with baseline data collected in 2002). This enabled us to examine the effects of livestock grazing on field vole abundance. 4. We have demonstrated experimentally for the first time that livestock grazing pressure affects the abundance of field voles (as measured by a vole sign index) in the uplands. In the first year of the experiment, immediate treatment effects were detectable, with a lower abundance of voles in the conventionally grazed treatment compared with those in the ungrazed treatment, and with intermediate vole abundances in the lightly grazed treatments. The significant treatment effects became more apparent in 2004, with a higher abundance of voles in the extensively grazed mixed treatment (i.e. sheep and cattle) than in the extensively grazed treatment that contained only sheep. 5. Synthesis and applications. In order to maximize biodiversity in the uplands, our results suggest that low intensity livestock grazing, used in a novel ways, could be a useful management tool to reduce vole abundance (and hence subsequent tree damage) compared with excluding livestock from young plantations completely. Furthermore, vole abundance would be higher at low grazing intensity compared with conventional stocking rates, thus still providing food for raptors and other vole-eating vertebrates. Indeed, low-intensity sheep and mixed livestock grazing might improve prey availability as a direct consequence of increased heterogeneity in vegetation structure. Our results suggest that it may be possible to maintain the open character of moorland habitats, and benefit key upland species generally, by reducing sheep grazing pressure and introducing low-intensity mixed livestock grazing throughout the uplands.},

abstract = {Adenovirus is an emerging threat to red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris conservation, but confirming clinically significant adenovirus infections in red squirrels is challenging. Rapid intestinal autolysis after death in wild animals frequently obscures pathology characteristic of the disease in animals found dead. We review the available literature to determine current understanding of both subclinical and clinically significant adenovirus infections in free-living wild and captive red squirrel populations. Benefits of scientific testing for adenovirus incorporating both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technologies are compared and contrasted. We favour viral particle detection using TEM in animals exhibiting enteropathy at post-mortem and the use of PCR to detect subclinical cases where no enteric abnormalities are observed. Adenoviral infections associated with re-introduction studies are evaluated by examination of sporadic cases in wild populations and of data from captive collections used to service such studies. The paucity of data available on adenovirus infection in grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis populations is documented, and we highlight that although subclinical virus presence is recorded in several locations in Great Britain and in Italy, no clinically significant disease cases have been detected in the species thus far. Current speculation about potential interspecific infection between sciurids and other woodland rodents such as wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus is examined. Where subclinical adenovirus presence has been detected in sympatric populations using the same point food sources, husbandry methods may be used to diminish the potential for cross-infection. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling disease in red squirrel populations by using clearly defined scientific methods. In addition, we propose hypothetical conservation benefits of restricting contact rates between red squirrels and sympatric grey squirrels and of limiting competition from other woodland rodent species.},

abstract = {Hunting foxes with hounds has been a countryside pursuit in Britain since the 17th Century, but its effect nationally on habitat management is little understood by the general public. A survey questionnaire was distributed to 163 mounted fox hunts of England and Wales to quantify their management practices in woodland and other habitat. Ninety-two hunts (56%), covering 75,514 km(2), returned details on woodland management motivated by the improvement of their sport. The management details were verified via on-site visits for a sample of 200 woodlands. Following verification, the area of woodlands containing the management was conservatively estimated at 24,053 (+/- 2241) ha, comprising 5.9% of woodland area within the whole of the area hunted by the 92 hunts. Management techniques included: tree planting, coppicing, felling, ride and perimeter management. A case study in five hunt countries in southern England examined, through the use of botanical survey and butterfly counts, the consequences of the hunt management on woodland ground flora and butterflies. Managed areas had, within the last 5 years, been coppiced and rides had been cleared. Vegetation cover in managed and unmanaged sites averaged 86% and 64%, respectively, and managed areas held on average 4 more plant species and a higher plant diversity than unmanaged areas (Shannon index of diversity: 2.25 vs. 1.95). Both the average number of butterfly species (2.2 vs. 0.3) and individuals counted (4.6 vs. 0.3) were higher in the managed than unmanaged sites.},

For infrequent attenders (proportion individual attendance <15%), females attended most often in autumn and winter, coinciding with the dispersal period. Male attendance was not higher during the breeding season. Our combined results show how feeding site attendance changes throughout the year relative to potential intrinsic and extrinsic factors.},

pages = {311-323},
abstract = {Roads are a potential threat to bat conservation. In addition to the direct risk of collision of bats with vehicles, roads could pose a threat to bat populations as a result of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, and could act as barriers to movements of bats between habitats. We performed a systematic review of the literature and conducted meta-analyses to assess the threat posed by roads to bats as a result of 1) collisions between bats and vehicles and 2) roads acting as barriers to movements of bats. Based on collated records of 1207 bat road casualties in Europe, we found that low-flying species are more prone to collisions than high-flying species, and that juveniles are more vulnerable to collisions than adults. In addition, meta-analysis identified a significant bias towards male casualties. Casualties included rare species such as Barbastella barbastellus and geographically restricted species such as Rhinolophus species. The bias towards male casualties could be indicative of greater natal philopatry or lower dispersal among females, or of sexual segregation in habitats of varying quality, i.e. females may occupy better quality habitats than males, and road density may be lower in better quality habitats. Whether or not roads act as barriers to the movement of bats depends on a complex interplay of habitat and species-specific behaviour. For example, the presence of favourable habitat for bats - notably woodland - was found in this review to be linked with significantly reduced barrier effects but a heightened risk of collision. Our data suggest that roads do pose a threat to bats. Future research should assess the contribution of traffic noise and street lighting to the barrier effect of roads. Where new road schemes are monitored by ecological practitioners, it is vital that consistent protocols are employed to ensure that bat activity can be compared before and after the road is built. Evidence from such research should be used to minimize the risks for bats of any roads built in the future, and to design safe crossing points for bats.},

Contiguous main setts were identified and bait-marking was used to estimate territory size. Group size was estimated by direct enumeration. Variation in sett density, group size and territory size supported the hypothesis that badger group and territory size are influenced by habitat type. This was further supported by analyses of data from other studies in the British Isles.

Intergrid movements were frequent (15.3% of all recaptures). A significant linear negative relationship was found between overall population sizes and degree of heterogeneity in habitat utilisation, although the former explained only about one-quarter of the variation in the latter (r(2) = 0.233). Wood mice were more evenly distributed among grids when numbers in the area were high, indicating density-dependence in their habitat utilisation. Demography was studied at subpopulation (grid) level to determine whether the observed pattern was due to movements among grids or to intergrid Variation in the balance between recruitment and losses. Partial regression coefficients in a multiple regression showed that emigration/immigration had a lesser role in explaining the pattern, although the former was significant in explaining part of subpopulation decreases and the latter was significant in explaining part of their increases. Differences in the balance between recruitment and loss rates among local subpopulations accounted for most of the observed density-dependent changes in habitat utilisation. These results do not support the view that such changes are mostly due to active choices made by individuals moving among habitats.},

Clear-felled areas showed least rodent diversity. Detrended Correspondence Analysis was used to describe the taxonomic and structural changes in vegetation during succession. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that in young plantations C. glareolus was associated with dense ground cover, provided mostly by heather. Microtus agrestis was most commonly associated with Deschampsia flexuosa, whereas A. sylvaticus was not strongly associated with any plant species. Spatial heterogeneity in soils explained much of the inter-site variation in vegetation which in rum explained much of the beta-diversity of rodent communities in young plantations.},

Male home-range areas varied seasonally, and were negatively correlated with population sizes, while female home ranges showed little seasonal variation. Survival and recruitment both declined sharply in late autumn, apparently in a density-dependent way. Except for this latter result, the population dynamics in a heterogeneous coniferous woodland were consistent with those described previously for this species in more homogeneous deciduous woodlands, suggesting that the same regulatory processes are operating in both habitats.},

However, A. canina was only rarely recognised in faeces, possibly as a result of the ease with which it disintegrated during digestion.

abstract = {(1) The population dynamics of Microtus agrestis (L.) inhabiting a young larch plantation in south-west Britain were studied from spring 1967 to spring 1969. As the larch trees grew they shaded out the ground layer vegetation and there was a resultant decline in vole density from 97/ha to 6/ha during the 2 main years of study. By the summer of 1972, this species had disappeared altogether. (2) Vole growth rates were significantly correlated with an index reflecting the abundance and rate of growth of the grasses which formed their main source of food. (3) Despite a good start to the breeding season in 1968, conditions deteriorated rapidly as a result of shading, and there was a considerable rise in perinatal mortality. (4) Rates of residency (minimum survival) were lowest during two main periods of the year. The first, in spring, involved mainly males, and coincided with the onset of sexual activity. The second, in summer, involved mainly females, and coincided with the replacement of overwinter residents by animals of the year. (5) Decreases in the rates of residency were correlated with increases in the distances moved between consecutive captures by male voles, reflecting a concomitant increase in the size of their home ranges. (6) Previously published records of male spring body weights from several parts of Britain were found to be significantly correlated with the standing crop of a meadow at Moor House Experimental Station and with the hay yields of the unfertilized control plots in the Rothamsted Park Grass Experiment. These correlations suggest a link between vole population fluctuations and climate. The effects of the quality or quantity of the spring food supply upon vole growth and reproduction could play an important part in this link.},

abstract = {Context The importance of habitat connectivity for wildlife is widely recognised. However, assessing the movement of species tends to rely on radio-tracking or GPS evidence, which is difficult and costly to gather. Objectives To examine functional connectivity of greater horseshoe bats (GHS, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) at a local scale using Circuitscape software; comparing our results against expert opinion 'fly ways'. Methods Expert opinions were used to rank and score five environmental layers influencing GHS movement, generating resistance scores. The slope and resistance scores of these layers were varied, and validated against independent ground truthed GHS activity data, until a unimodal peak in correlation was identified for each layer. The layers were combined into a multivariate model and re-evaluated. Radio-tracking studies were used to further validate the model, and the transferability was tested at other roost locations. Results Functional connectivity models could be created using bat activity data. Models had the ability to be transferred between roost locations, although site-specific validation is strongly recommended. For all other bat species recorded, markedly more (125%) bat passes occurred in the top quartile of functional connectivity compared to any of the lower three quartiles. Conclusion The model predictions identify areas of key conservation importance to habitat connectivity for GHS that are not recognised by expert opinion. By highlighting landscape features that act as barriers to movement, this approach can be used by decision-makers as a tool to inform local management strategies.},

The overall density of woodland in the vicinity, the distance to a wood of at least 0.5 ha in size, and the presence/absence of five other tree species did not influence squirrel drey distribution between the woods. 4. In woods that contained squirrel dreys, density was higher in woods with a greater density of large trees (diameter in excess of 50 cm) and in woods which were closer to another wood of at least 0.5 ha in size. 5.

abstract = {1. The results of this study, which surveyed 38 farm woods ranging in size from 0.05 to 4.45 ha, demonstrated clearly that the dynamics of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus and bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus populations in small woods are strongly influenced by the landscape around the woods, for example the distance to neighbouring woods, abundance of hedges and types of crops grown, as well as the habitat within the wood. 2. In terms of the habitat features of the woods, the maturity of the wood and the amount of understorey and overstorey cover were important for both species, while the availability of herbaceous plants influenced bank vole abundance. 3. Wood mice, in particular, were influenced by the types of crops grown in neighbouring fields. Their abundance in spring, the proportion of juveniles in the autumn and the extent to which the population increased from spring to autumn were all influenced by the proportion of adjoining fields that were planted with wheat and/or oilseed rape. 4. Isolation variables, such as the distance to the nearest large wood and the extent of adjoining hedgerows, influenced both wood mice and bank vole populations. Populations of both species increased more from spring to autumn in more isolated woods. This was probably because of reduced opportunities for dispersal and the shortage of alternative woodland habitat for animals moving off the fields after harvest. Woods well connected with hedges supported higher densities of both wood mice and bank voles. 5. Within the size range of woods examined here, no effect of woodland size was found on the probability of catching wood mice or bank voles or their abundance in either spring or autumn. The data suggest that even very small farm woods are important as refuges for small mammals, particularly after harvest when arable fields provide little cover.},

The roost was predominantly used during the spring and autumn, and acted as a link between maternity roosts and hibernacula. Compositional analysis of ranging behavior collected in the spring revealed that R. ferrumequinum? selected grazed pastures and broad-leaved woodland compared with other available habitat. Diet analysis revealed that there was little difference between the diet of individuals using the transitional roost and the nearest known R. ferrumequinum maternity colony. Broad-leaved woodlands within 4 km of transitional roosts used by R. ferrumequinum in the spring should be protected to help conserve this species.},

abstract = {"Bottom-up" influences, that is, masting, plus population density and climate, commonly influence woodland rodent demography. However, "top-down" influences (predation) also intervene. Here, we assess the impacts of masting, climate, and density on rodent populations placed in the context of what is known about "top-down" influences. To explain between-year variations in bank vole Myodes glareolus and wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus population demography, we applied a state-space model to 33years of catch-mark-release live-trapping, winter temperature, and precise mast-collection data. Experimental mast additions aided interpretation. Rodent numbers in European ash Fraxinus excelsior woodland were estimated (May/June, November/December). December-March mean minimum daily temperature represented winter severity. Total marked adult mice/voles (and juveniles in May/June) provided density indices validated against a model-generated population estimate; this allowed estimation of the structure of a time-series model and the demographic impacts of the climatic/biological variables. During two winters of insignificant fruit-fall, 6.79g/m(2) sterilized ash seed (as fruit) was distributed over an equivalent woodland similarly live-trapped. September-March fruit-fall strongly increased bank vole spring reproductive rate and winter and summer population growth rates; colder winters weakly reduced winter population growth. September-March fruit-fall and warmer winters marginally increased wood mouse spring reproductive rate and September-December fruit-fall weakly elevated summer population growth. Density dependence significantly reduced both species' population growth. Fruit-fall impacts on demography still appeared after a year. Experimental ash fruit addition confirmed its positive influence on bank vole winter population growth with probable moderation by colder temperatures. The models show the strong impact of masting as a "bottom-up" influence on rodent demography, emphasizing independent masting and weather influences; delayed effects of masting; and the importance of density dependence and its interaction with masting. We conclude that these rodents show strong "bottom-up" and density-dependent influences on demography moderated by winter temperature. "Top-down" influences appear weak and need further investigation.},

pages = {296-306},
abstract = {During the past 50 years two readily distinguishable rabbit-specific diseases caused by Myxoma virus (MYXV) and Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) respectively, have decimated wild rabbit populations worldwide. Combined with the use of these viruses as bio-control agents, the consequences for farming, commercial rabbit breeding and rare habitat conservation dependent on rabbit grazing, have been both positive and negative. Moreover, rare predators that rely on rabbits as a food resource, and even hunters, have suffered the consequences of rabbit populations being affected by one or other of these viruses. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus was first identified after thousands of domestic rabbits died suddenly in China in 1984. Similar epidemics subsequently occurred in other regions of Asia, the Middle East, Europe and North America, suggesting that the virus had dispersed widely following its emergence in China. However, the discovery that RHDV had circulated apparently harmlessly for many years before the first recognised epidemic in China prompted us to investigate the evolution, emergence and dispersal of this virus in relation to its impact on conservation of wildlife species. Accordingly, we have sequenced new isolates of RHDV and combined these data with a global selection of available RHDV sequences. Using phylogenetic analysis we demonstrate that the Chinese epidemic virus diverged from European viruses that circulated many years prior to 1984. We also demonstrate that the lineages of the pathogenic viruses that emerged in the UK in the early 1990s, are distinct from and pre-date those of the 1984 Chinese virus. In other words, European strains of RHDV emerged from apparently harmless strains to cause epidemic outbreaks, independently of the Chinese 1984 epidemic virus. These studies demonstrate how understanding viral epidemiology can improve the development of strategies to conserve rabbits, rare predator species and the habitat. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Understanding the dispersal behaviour of a species is important for understanding its ecology and evolution. Dispersal in the Eurasian badger (Meles meles) is believed to be very limited, with social groups forming primarily through the retention of offspring. However, most of our knowledge of dispersal in this species comes from studies of high-density populations in the United Kingdom, where badgers are atypical in their behaviour, physiology, ecology and prey specialization. In this study we use genetic methods to compare dispersal patterns in a British and a Swiss population that differ in their ecology and demography. We present well-supported evidence that badgers disperse much further in the low-density continental population, where dispersal may also be female biased. Limited dispersal thus seems not to be an intrinsic behavioural characteristic of the species. Rather, dispersal patterns seem to vary depending on population demography and, ultimately, habitat quality and characteristics. This could have important management consequences, as dispersal can affect the impact of local extinction, and host dispersal has a particularly important role in disease transmission. Even though concentrated studies of a species in a single location may not provide representative data for the species, there are few mammalian studies that compare demography and dispersal patterns across contrasting habitats. Our results provide an example of phenotypic plasticity and suggest that dispersal is determined by the interaction of individual, social and environmental factors that may differ between populations.

We aimed to characterize the range expansion of the American mink (Neovison vison) invading from multiple introduction points through a varied landscape bounded by coastline to better understand and manage its spread. LocationScotland, UK. MethodWe collated and used records of mink presence to calculate the historical range and rate of range expansion at successive time intervals. We used a presence-only model to predict habitat suitability and a newly developed individual-based modelling platform, RangeShifter, to simulate range expansion. ResultsRecords showed that mink were distributed throughout Scotland, except in the far north. We found that the rate of spread varied both spatially and temporally and was related to landscape heterogeneity. Habitat suitable for mink in west Scotland is restricted to the coast. Main conclusionsWe concluded that temporal and spatial variation in range expansion is attributable to heterogeneity within the landscape and also demonstrated that the potential for long-distance dispersal does not necessarily facilitate range expansion when availability of suitable habitat occurs in narrow strips and/or is fragmented. We have highlighted methodological gaps in calculating rates of expansion in invasive species but have demonstrated alternative methods that successfully utilize presence-only data. Our study reaffirms that invasive species will colonize less favourable habitats and highlights the need to remain vigilant of their potential for expansion even when distribution appears to be static for a time.},

abstract = {The detrimental effect of invasive species on native ecosystems is well established and motivates management strategies to reduce their impact. Eradication can be difficult in mainland areas but control is often a feasible option, providing recolonisation of control areas is minimised. Molecular genetic techniques can be used to define management units in invasive populations and these can be used to target efforts effectively for invasive species control. The American mink is an invasive predator in many countries following introduction through fur farming. Its colonisation of a variety of habitats has devastated many native bird and small mammal populations thus control is of utmost importance. The spread of mink throughout Scotland, UK, is reasonably well documented and projects designed to manage mink are currently underway. In order to provide practical advice for mink management both in Scotland and elsewhere, over 500 mink were genotyped at 12 microsatellite loci to resolve genetic structure, delimit populations and establish patterns of connectivity across areas. STRUCTURE-based analyses identified mink populations in the west and east of Scotland as belonging to different genetic clusters and variation in gene flow between populations was found within and between these clusters. Landscape features were shown to affect the rate and direction of colonisation, with mountains restricting and valleys facilitating dispersal. Recommendations for reducing the distribution of mink in Scotland, based on these findings, are provided which can be applied to both mink and general invasive species control. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. With changes in the agricultural policy for rural areas in the UK there is increased interest in the development of management protocols for indigenous and sown swards in upland Scotland based on grazing by ruminant species other than sheep and cattle, e.g. goats, red deer and South American camelids. 2. Here we describe the diet composition over two seasons of goats, red deer and South American camelids (guanacos) grazing three vegetation types typical of upland ecosystems in the UK: a sown sward (Lolium perenne-dominated), an indigenous grassland (Nardus stricta-dominated) and a dwarf shrub community (Calluna vulgaris-dominated). 3. On each vegetation type, all three animal species were selective feeders. The composition of the goats' diet was more variable than that of the red deer and guanacos. All three species were more selective when grazing the indigenous communities than when grazing the sown sward. 4. On the Lolium sward, the guanacos avoided clover and other dicotyledonous plants, whilst the goats and red deer consumed green leaf from all plant categories found at or near the sward surface. 5. On the Nardus community, all three species avoided the dominant tussock-grass and selected green lamina of broad-leaved grasses from the species-rich inter-tussock areas. Between-species differences in minor components included an increased contribution of non-grass monocotyledonous plants to the goats' diet in spring, and a higher proportion of grass flowerstem and grass seed/flowerhead in the guanacos' diet in summer. 6. The diets of the three species of animal on the Calluna community were broadly similar. All generally avoided C. vulgaris and strongly selected graminoid species. Consumption of grass was greater in spring than summer. 7. Species differences in diet composition, particularly on indigenous swards dominated by N. stricta and C. vulgaris, might facilitate vegetation management and improve animal output using multispecies grazing systems.},

abstract = {1. With changes in the agricultural policy for rural areas in the UK, there is increased pressure to develop management protocols for indigenous and sown swards based on grazing by ruminant species other than sheep and cattle, e.g. goats, red deer and South American camelids. This can only be achieved through a greater understanding of the feeding behaviour of these species grazing on vegetation communities typical of the hills and uplands. 2. This paper describes the organic matter intake, diet digestibility and activity time of goats, red deer and South American camelids grazing three vegetation types typical of upland ecosystems in Scotland: a sown grassland (Lolium perenne-dominated), an indigenous grassland (Nardus stricta-dominated) and a dwarf-shrub community (Calluna vulgaris-dominated). Intake and digestibility of organic matter (OM) were measured by the n-alkane technique, and activity time was measured using vibracorders. 3. For all species OM digestibility of the diet was higher on the sown sward than on the indigenous communities, and higher on the indigenous grassland than on the dwarf-shrub community. There were no consistent patterns to between-species differences in OM digestibility. 5. When expressed on a metabolic liveweight basis, there was no consistent pattern to the seasonal differences in OM intake (OMI) between species or within species between vegetation types. 6. Irrespective of season, grazing session or vegetation type, activity time of the goats was significantly lower than that of either the red deer or camelids. 7. The conclusions of the study are that these species differ in their foraging strategy, particularly on indigenous communities where heterogeneity in resource dispersion and availability is higher. Goats and camelids maintain diet digestibility at the expense of intake, whereas red deer maintain intake.},

The distribution of the water shrew was determined from seats left in bait tubes placed at chosen sites. Water shrews were found at 20 of the 41 sites investigated. The two major factors that determined the presence of water shrews at a site were found to be the presence of freshwater crustaceans (positive) and the presence of short grass (negative). Although aquatic prey and bank management played predominant roles in deciding whether shrews were present at a site, it is likely that other factors (notably water quality) also play a role in determining site occupancy. The evidence suggests that the actions of man in managing riparian environments can be detrimental to the water shrew, and may result in local absences of N. fodiens.},

abstract = {Although populations of many bat species appear to be recovering in some European countries, the extrinsic and intrinsic factors driving these increases have not yet been assessed. Disentangling the benefits of conservation management from other factors such as climate change is a crucial step for improving evidence-based conservation strategies. We used the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) as a case study for understanding the recovery of bat populations, as its north-western populations have increased substantially over the past two decades following severe population declines. Using summer roost count data from the UK National Bat Monitoring Programme spanning an 18 year period from 1997 to 2014, we investigated the effects of (i) landscape characteristics associated with the implementation of the agri-environment schemes on colony trends and size, and (ii) meteorological variables on annual colony growth rate. We also assessed the relationship between colony size and colony growth to investigate intrinsic factors such as an Allee effect. Our results indicated that colony size was positively related to a range of landscape features (e.g. amount of broadleaf woodland and grassland, and density of linear features) surrounding the roost, while the amount of artificial light at night had a significant negative effect. Spring temperatures and precipitation (the latter with a lag of one year) were associated with annual colony growth. We also identified a negative density-dependence effect within colonies. Though the conservation of essential landscape elements may have contributed to population increases in the long-term, we conclude that recent population recovery has also been driven by climate change. Finally we recommend that the conservation of photophobic bat species such as R. ferrumequinum should focus on both the improvement of foraging/commuting habitats and the creation of dark areas.},

abstract = {Mitigating the detrimental impacts of intensive farming on biodiversity requires the implementation of cost-effective conservation actions. Targeted agri-environment schemes (AESs) to enhance populations of threatened species inhabiting farmland have been proposed for this purpose, yet their effectiveness for nocturnal wildlife remains unknown. We assessed whether hedgerow management prescribed by targeted AESs to improve habitat conditions for the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) in England may positively influence the species, the entire bat assemblage and the insect prey of bats. We specifically investigated the responses of bats (occurrence, activity and species richness) and insects (biomass, abundance and diversity) to time since last trimming (from 1 up to 10 years). We explored the mechanisms underlying the effects of AES via changes in trimming regime on bats. Moreover, we investigated the effects of landscape context on bats as we expected that highly mobile species would benefit further from landscape-scale management. Bat species richness significantly increased with time since last trimming. Three bat taxa of major conservation concern in Western Europe substantially benefited from the targeted prescription, namely R. ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Plecotus spp. Insect family richness and dipteran abundance were also significantly greater at hedgerows that were untrimmed for at least 3 years. The activity of more common bat species (i.e. pipistrelle bats) was not influenced by time since last trimming. Changes in trimming regime strongly affected hedgerow height which directly and indirectly (by increasing prey abundance) influenced bat occurrence, activity and species richness along hedgerows. The activity of highly mobile bat species was mainly associated with a range of landscape attributes. The amount of semi-natural grassland within 0.5 km of the sampling sites positively influenced R. ferrumequinum while the presence of urban areas negatively affected light-sensitive bat species. Synthesis and applications. The implementation of targeted agri-environment schemes can include effective measures to enhance bats and their insect prey in farmland. Although we highlight the success of current prescriptions on hedgerow management, we suggest that their effectiveness can easily be optimized by encouraging farmers to keep hedgerows untrimmed for longer periods (>3 up to 10 years). We also highlight that a multi-scale management approach is required to successfully promote bats in farmland.},

journal = {Animal Conservation},
pages = {10},
abstract = {The disturbance, damage and destruction of roosts are key drivers of bat population declines worldwide. In countries where bats are protected by law, bat roost surveys are often required to inform ecological impact assessments. Yet, evidence-based information on survey methodology to detect bat roosts is crucially lacking, and failing to detect a roost can lead to serious errors during decision-making processes. Here, we assess the efficacy of bat roost surveys in buildings as implemented in the UK. These consist of a daytime inspection of buildings, followed by a series of acoustic surveys at dusk/dawn if during the daytime inspection evidence of bats is found, or if the absence of bats cannot be verified. We reviewed 155 ecological consultants' reports to (1) compare survey outcome between daytime inspection and acoustic surveys and (2) determine the minimum sampling effort required during acoustic surveys to be confident that no bats are roosting within a building. We focused on two genera of bats most frequently found in buildings in Europe - Pipistrellus (crevice roosting species with high-intensity echolocation calls that can be easily detected by ultrasound detectors) and Plecotus (species that roost in open spaces and which emit faint echolocation calls that are difficult to detect). Daytime inspections were efficient in detecting open-roosting species such as Plecotus species but were likely to miss the presence of crevice-dwelling ones (here Pipistrellus species) which may lead to erroneous conclusions if no acoustic surveys are subsequently prescribed to confirm their absence. A minimum of three and four acoustic surveys are required to be 95% confident that a building does not host a roost of Pipistrellus species and Plecotus species, respectively, thus exceeding current recommendations. Overall, we demonstrated that reports submitted as part of an ecological impact assessment provide suitable data to test and improve survey methods.},

Using longitudinal census observations collected over four decades from two long-term individual-based studies of unmanaged ungulates, we demonstrate consistent within-individual declines in home range area with age in adult females. In both systems, we found that within-individual decreases in home range area were associated with increased risk of mortality the following year. Our results provide the first evidence from the wild that age-related changes in space use are predictive of adult mortality.},

We use a 43 year dataset from a wild population of red deer to examine the relative importance of two factors that influence the costs of reproduction to mothers, and to test whether these costs vary with changing ecological conditions. Like previous studies, our analyses indicate fitness costs of lactation: mothers whose calves survived the summer subsequently showed lower survival and fecundity than those whose calves died soon after birth, accounting for 5% and 14% of the variation in mothers' survival and fecundity, respectively. The production of a male calf depressed maternal survival and fecundity more than production of a female, but accounted for less than 1% of the variation in either fitness component. There was no evidence for any change in the effect of calf survival or sex with increasing population density.},

abstract = {Habitat loss and fragmentation greatly affect biological diversity. Actions to counteract their negative effects include increasing the quality, amount and connectivity of seminatural habitats at the landscape scale. However, much of the scientific evidence underpinning landscape restoration comes from studies of habitat loss and fragmentation, and it is unclear whether the ecological principles derived from habitat removal investigations are applicable to habitat creation. In addition, the relative importance of local- (e.g., improving habitat quality) vs. landscape-level (e.g., increasing habitat connectivity) actions to restore species is largely unknown, partly because studying species responses over sufficiently large spatial and temporal scales is challenging. We studied small mammal responses to large-scale woodland creation spanning 150 yr, and assessed the influence of local- and landscape-level characteristics on three small mammal species of varying woodland affinity. Woodland specialists, generalists, and grassland specialists were present in woodlands across a range of ages from 10 to 160 yr, demonstrating that these species can quickly colonize newly created woodlands. However, we found evidence that woodlands become gradually better over time for some species. The responses of individual species corresponded to their habitat specificity. A grassland specialist (Microtus agrestis) was influenced only by landscape attributes; a woodland generalist (Apodemus sylvaticus) and specialist (Myodes glareolus) were primarily influenced by local habitat attributes, and partially by landscape characteristics. At the local scale, high structural heterogeneity, large amounts of deadwood, and a relatively open understory positively influenced woodland species (both generalists and specialists); livestock grazing had strong negative effects on woodland species abundance. Actions to enhance habitat quality at the patch scale focusing on these attributes would benefit these species. Woodland creation in agricultural landscapes is also likely to benefit larger mammals and birds of prey feeding on small mammals and increase ecosystem processes such as seed dispersal.},

journal = {Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment},

abstract = {Agricultural expansion has led to the widespread destruction of habitats and the creation of fragmented landscapes. Woodland has been severely affected by habitat loss; remaining woodland is often highly fragmented and degraded, immersed in an agricultural matrix. Woodland is one of the most important habitats for bats because it offers roosting and feeding opportunities for many species. A number of agri-environment schemes aim to increase the amount and quality of woodland on agricultural land; however, little is known about how woodland character relates to bat abundance/activity and recommendations for woodland creation and management for foraging bats are scarce. We studied temperate bat communities and examined bat foraging activity and relative abundance (and insect prey availability) in 34 woodland fragments in agricultural landscapes using two complementary methods (acoustic monitoring and trapping assisted by an acoustic lure). We evaluated the relative importance of woodland vegetation character, patch configuration and surrounding landscape in order to assess the importance of local- vs. landscape-scale woodland management to bat populations. Bat abundance and activity were influenced by both local and landscape-level attributes. At the local scale, woodland vegetation character appeared more important than patch configuration. High activity levels of aerial hawkers (e.g. Pipistrellus species) were related to low tree densities and an open understory, while gleaning species (e.g. Myotis bats) showed the opposite trend. Areas of cluttered vegetation were associated with high insect (mostly Diptera) abundance and could act as sources of prey for certain bat species. Bats' responses to the surrounding landscape depended on species mobility. For relatively low mobility species (e.g. Pipistrellus pygmaeus), local woodland character was more important than the landscape context, whereas the opposite was observed for higher mobility species (e.g. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Myotis bats). Higher bat activity levels were observed in small and isolated woodland fragments, and in sparsely wooded landscapes. This may reflect a more intensive use of woodland in landscapes where this habitat is scarce, where woodland creation should be prioritised. Woodland management and creation schemes should encourage habitat heterogeneity to fulfil the requirements of different bat species. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Agricultural intensification is a major cause of biodiversity declines. Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced in many countries as an attempt to counteract the negative effects of intensive agriculture by providing financial incentives for farmers to adopt environmentally-sensitive agricultural practices. We surveyed 18 pairs of AES and conventionally-managed farms in central Scotland (United Kingdom) to evaluate the effects of specific AES management prescriptions (field margins, hedgerows, species-rich grasslands and water margins) on foraging bats and nocturnal insects. In addition, we assessed the importance of habitat in the wider landscape at several spatial scales on foraging bats and their insect prey. Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus were the most commonly recorded species, accounting for 98% of total bat activity levels. Overall levels of bat activity and the abundance of their insect prey (mainly Diptera and Trichoptera) were lower (by 40-50%) on farms participating in AES than on non-participating farms. Differences in insect abundance were also significant when we compared specific AES management prescriptions with equivalent conventionally-managed features. The surrounding landscape influenced bat activity; fragmentation metrics related to woodland configuration were the most important landscape characteristics influencing bat activity levels. However, the two Pipistrelle species responded differently to the surrounding landscape, P. pipistrellus being strongly influenced by the landscape at large scales (e.g. within 2 km of the monitoring site) and P. pygmaeus being most influenced by the landscape at smaller scales (within 500 m of the monitoring site). Insect abundance was positively affected by the percentage cover of semi-natural environment within 500 m of trapping sites. We suggest that the implementation of the four common AES management prescriptions assessed in this study does not benefit Pipistrelle bats nor other bat species foraging on similar prey. Such species may respond more positively to a landscape-scale management approach focused mainly on the creation and management of woodland. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the UK, four out of 18 bat species are listed on the EU Habitats Directive, including the lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros), and their population status is closely monitored by visiting known roosts. R. hipposideros predominantly form maternity roosts in buildings, but roosts are impermanent features in the landscape and their distribution changes as bats form new roosts and abandon others. Locating new roosts requires intensive surveys which are challenging and inefficient. In this study, we provide a novel model-based strategy to identify potential R. hipposideros maternity roost sites that can be used to monitor bat populations. First, we model potential maternity roost habitat using record centre data on roost locations across Wales, Great Britain. We then constrain the area identified from modelling using record centre data on locations of bats in areas with no known roosts. We used two variable selection methods and three pseudo-absence data sets (random background points, random points in buildings and target group selection of mammal records) to produce six habitat suitability models. The three pseudo-absence data sets produced different habitat suitability maps, demonstrating the influence of pseudo-absence selection on species distribution models. The six models were combined using weighted mean average to produce an ensemble model that performed better than individual models and that indicated high levels of congruence in areas predicted to have high habitat suitability for maternity roosts. Our model revealed an extensive area (6523 km(2); 31% of the area of Wales) containing 18,051 buildings in suitable habitat. Using record centre data on bat activity outside commuting range from known roosts reduced the potential survey area to 133 km(2) (0.6% of the area of Wales) and 207 buildings. Our modelling outputs can be used to direct volunteers and bat surveyors in more targeted and efficient searches.},

abstract = {Wings are the most obvious adaptation bats have for powered flight and differences in wing morphology are known to correlate with flight behaviour. However, the function(s) of ancillary structures such as the cars and tail, which may also play an important role during flight, are less well understood. Here we constructed a simplified model of a bat body with cars based upon morphological measurements of a brown long-eared bat (Plecouts auritus) to examine the aerodynamic implications of flying with large cars. The forces and moments produced by the model were measured using a sensitive 6-component force and torque balance during wind tunnel testing. The large cars of the model bat produced positive lift as well as positive drag of the same order of magnitude. At small ears angles (0 degrees to 10 degrees), increasing the angle of the ears resulted in an increase of the lift-to-drag ratio. At higher car angles (> 10 degrees) separation of the flow occurred which caused a large decrease in the lift-to-drag ratio produced. To maximise the benefit from the ears (i.e., lift-to-drag ratio) our model predicts that a horizontal free flying P auritus should hold its ears at an approximate angle of 10 degrees. The results of the pitching moment coefficient are inconclusive in determining if the large cars are important as flight control structures. The additional drag produced by the ears has consequences for the foraging behaviour of P. auritus with reductions in its night speed and foraging range.},

abstract = {Applying competing ethical theories to the issue of bovine TB and badger culling can throw light on the validity of the policy options. Utilitarianism is, superficially at least, an attractive option. However, the aggregative principle is problematic and this is well illustrated in the case of bovine TB and badger culling. Such is the variety and strength of interests to be considered that it is not at all clear which course of action will maximise utility. In addition, it may be that the full range of consequences can never be known with any degree of accuracy. An alternative option is to revert to an animal welfare ethic. This has the effect of cutting down the moral complexities involved in a discussion of bovine TB and badger culling, since, providing it is done humanely, killing badgers is not an ethical issue, and even the infliction of suffering on them is permissible providing it serves a significant human benefit. The animal welfare ethic, however, is normatively inadequate because it exaggerates the ethical importance of personhood. Because of this, it allows us to justify killing badgers, and might even justify the infliction of considerable suffering if by so doing there is a good chance that economic benefits will accrue. As a result, a deontological position, where animals are accorded the protection of rights, seems a much more promising alternative to utilitarianism. The adoption of any variety of animal rights would render badger culling morally illegitimate.},

abstract = {Nocturnal observations, radio telemetry and time-lapse camera surveillance were used to investigate visits by badgers (Meles meles L.) to two cattle farms. During 59 half-nights (ca. 295 h) of observation and 17 nights (ca. 154 h) of camera surveillance, 139 separate visits to farm buildings, by at least 26 individually identifiable badgers from two social groups, were recorded. The badgers, which included three individuals infected with bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), used cowsheds, feedsheds, barns, haystacks, slurry pits, cattle troughs and farmyards to exploit a range of food resources, including cattle feed and silage. Cattle feed was contaminated with badger faeces and badgers also came into close contact with cattle. The minimum number of badgers visiting farm buildings per night was negatively correlated with local 24 h rainfall. We conclude that exploitation by badgers of resources provided by cattle farms constitutes a potentially important mechanism for tuberculosis transmission from badgers to cattle.},

Many small mammal species prefer long grass as a habitat that offers protection from predation, and past studies on the consequences of grass cutting to small mammals have yielded mixed results. Using live trapping, we show that although mowing grass causes a rapid decline in small mammal captures, a small proportion of captures (20%-27%) still occurred in patches of mown grass immediately after cutting. This proportion more than halved again when the cut grass that was initially left in situ was removed. We conclude that some small mammals may remain in mown areas provided some form of cover - i.e. the cut grass - is present. These findings are discussed in light of agri-environment scheme options (e.g. grass margins) that could be improved to benefit birds of prey.},

abstract = {In November 2016, the Scottish Government announced that they were minded to allow the two 'trial' reintroduced populations of Eurasian beaver Castor fiber to remain in Scotland and be allowed to expand naturally, and that the species will receive legal protection. This was a historic moment: the first formally approved reintroduction of a mammal species anywhere in the United Kingdom. The issues surrounding beaver reintroduction to Scotland had been the subject of intense investigation and public debate over the previous 21years. Extensive multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary work was performed to assess the desirability and feasibility of reintroducing the Eurasian beaver and informed the government's decision. This was one of the most detailed assessments carried out for any species reintroduction proposal. The work was broadly divided into desk-based and stand-alone studies based primarily on the European and North American experience of living with beavers, the scientifically monitored Scottish Beaver Trial reintroduction in west Scotland, a study of beavers resulting from unauthorised releases in an east Scotland catchment and the work of a specialist group that examined beaver-salmonid interactions and issues. It was confirmed that beavers have a very positive influence on biodiversity overall, although some specific species and habitats of high conservation importance can be adversely affected if appropriate management is not in place. Beavers provide a range of ecosystem services with the potential for socio-economic benefits. However, beavers' activities may affect some land uses, the extent and significance depending on local conditions. Management techniques are well developed, although some will require refinement and appropriate licensing within a Scottish regulatory regime. A strategic approach to developing management throughout Scotland will need to be progressed in partnership with key stakeholders.},

abstract = {Linear habitats are becoming increasingly common as a consequence of habitat fragmentation, and may provide the sole habitat for some species. Hedgerows are linear features that can vary substantially in structure and quality. Having surveyed 180 hedgerows, in four locations, and sampled their small mammal communities we examined the effect of physical hedgerow attributes on the abundance of small mammal species. Using three elements of landscape structure, we explored whether variation was best explained by the Random Sample Hypothesis (that small islands represent a random sample of those species populating larger areas), or by the Fragmentation Hypothesis (that species abundance will decrease with a loss of habitat area). We tested the relationship between the relative abundance of small mammals and 1. hedgerow connectivity; 2. total habitat availability and 3. local habitat complexity. We then explored the predictive power of combinations of these habitat variables. Connectivity was a positive predictor of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus, and hedgerow gappiness was a negative predictor of bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus. The total amount of habitat available (hedgerow width, height and length) was a positive indicator of total small mammal biomass. These results support the Fragmentation Hypothesis that species abundance and distribution decrease with a loss of habitat area. The preservation of linear and associated habitats may therefore be important in maintaining metapopulations of the species we studied.},

pages = {39-44},
abstract = {Agricultural intensification has been widespread worldwide over the last decades and has lead to a loss of semi-natural habitats. These changes are likely to have affected both the composition and diversity of small mammal communities living in agricultural landscapes. In this context, we compared population abundance (expressed as an index of relative abundance), species richness (S), and species diversity (expressed as Shannon and Pielou indexes) of small mammal assemblages (i.e. sub-sets of the entire small mammal community) living in three areas in North-East Italy positioned along a gradient of agricultural land-use intensification (measured with the Landscape Conservation Index). We expected that assemblages would be less diverse and dominated by generalist species where the landscape was more intensely cultivated and where semi-natural habitats were less common. In the three areas, from a total of 4630 trap-nights, 668 individuals were captured with Sherman traps, belonging to four species (Apodemus agrarius, A. flavicollis, A. sylvaticus and Microtus arvalis). The results showed that population abundance, type of species present (but not species richness), and species diversity were affected by agricultural intensification and landscape naturalness. In particular, moving from less natural to more natural landscapes, we observed no effect on richness of species but increasing diversity due to a greater abundance of the more specialist species, such as A. agrarius and, partially, A. flavicollis, the latter only present in the most natural area. Generalist species, namely A. sylvaticus, and those associated with disturbed environments, such as M. arvalis, were instead more abundant in less natural landscapes. When considering population abundance, the highest overall abundance of small mammals was found in the most disturbed landscape. The results were consistent with those of research carried out in other agroecosystems of Europe and highlight the controversial effect of the anthropogenic impact on small mammal assemblages, since a decrease in species diversity may be associated with an increased overall population abundance, due to the success of few generalist species.},

Collection of data on mammal road casualties can be carried out by untrained volunteers; it can be collected across large areas; and it is cost effective in terms of time and expense. We carried out a study to determine if road casualty data can be used to monitor mammal abundance and distribution using one of the most commonly recorded road casualty species in the UK, the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), as an example. We found a direct relationship between the numbers of rabbit road casualties and the numbers living in the wider landscape. Nearly 60% of the deviance in the live rabbit density index could be explained using only rabbit road casualty, landclass group and traffic flow data. Therefore the use of road casualty data is a cost effective method of monitoring rabbits and, by implication, other species over a large area in the UK, and is a highly effective means of monitoring terrestrial mammals.},

abstract = {The management of wildlife hosts for controlling parasites and disease has a history of mixed success. Deer can be important hosts for ticks, such as Ixodes ricinus, which is the primary vector of disease-causing zoonotic pathogens in Europe. Deer are generally managed by culling and fencing for forestry protection, habitat conservation, and commercial hunting, and in this study we test whether these deer management methods can be useful for controlling ticks, with implications for tick-borne pathogens. At different spatial scales and habitats we tested the hypotheses that tick abundance is reduced by (1) culling deer and (2) deer exclusion using fencing. We compared abundance indices of hosts and questing I. ricinus nymphs using a combination of small-scale fencing experiments on moorland, a large-scale natural experiment of fenced and unfenced pairs of forests, and cross-sectional surveys of forest and moorland areas with varying deer densities. As predicted, areas with fewer deer had fewer ticks, and fenced exclosures had dramatically fewer ticks in both large-scale forest and small-scale moorland plots. Fencing and reducing deer density were also associated with higher ground vegetation. The implications of these results on other hosts, pathogen prevalence, and disease risk are discussed. This study provides evidence of how traditional management methods of a keystone species can reduce a generalist parasite, with implications for disease risk mitigation.},

journal = {Biological Conservation},

abstract = {Urbanisation is among the most ecologically damaging change in land use, posing significant threats to global biodiversity. Most bat species are threatened by urbanisation, although urban areas can also offer important roosting and foraging opportunities. Urban development should consider how bats are likely to respond to development, and take measures to minimise impacts. We used acoustic data from four years of citizen science monitoring (2013-2016) to quantify the importance of fine-scale habitat configuration and composition for bats in urban areas in eastern England. Bat distribution and activity were analysed in relation to remote sensing data representing impervious surface, waterbodies and tree-cover density. Furthermore, hypothetical future scenarios of urban development were considered, assuming an increase in impervious or woodland surface. Lakes and discontinuous woodland were the most selected habitats and urban areas were the least selected, with Barbastellus, Myotis and Plecotus species being the most vulnerable. Nyctalus, Pipistrellus and Eptesicus species were less influenced by the presence of urban areas. Our results suggest that urban growth should be sought through the expansion of existing urban blocks, rather than creating new urban patches, to minimise impacts on commuting or foraging sites. Creating bat-friendly habitat of an area at least equal to any new urban settlement could provide mitigation for negative effects of urbanisation. Opportunities to increase areas of discontinuous woodland should be encouraged, while preserving unmanaged areas within large plantations would likely support the exploitation of continuous woodland by bats.},

journal = {Ibis},
volume = {149},
pages = {119-127},
abstract = {The effects of deer in woodlands are known to result in habitat changes which can be detrimental to songbirds. In the first part of the paper we review the effects that deer may have on critical resources for woodland birds. The principal mechanism by which deer may affect habitat quality is through the reduction of low woody vegetation, which forms a key element of the preferred habitat of several species - this may be associated with loss of nest-sites, increased exposure to predators and reduction of food. The second part of the paper presents new evidence for the impacts of deer on vegetation structure, and how they may be contributing to the declines of some woodland songbirds in Britain. Results from extensive studies of deer at 13 woodland sites in England and Wales reveal that understorey foliage density decreases significantly with increasing deer density. Reduction of foliage was greatest at below 1.5 m above ground. We also report preliminary results of an experimental comparison of songbird densities between deer-fenced and unfenced areas of young coppice woodland in eastern England. In this study, deer browsing caused extensive impacts on vegetation structure in young coppice, though there was considerable variation between plots. Deer browsing resulted in reduction of canopy cover, reduction in density and cover of understorey vegetation, and an increase in grass cover. Abundance of bird species using the understorey, including all migrants, was significantly higher in coppice where deer were excluded. These results lend support to the hypothesis that deer are at least partly responsible for causing declines in some British bird populations, but they do not eliminate the possibility that increased shading is also responsible for changes in woodland structure. At present there is much spatial variation in deer densities in Britain so that impacts on low vegetation and habitat quality for birds are not expected to be the same in all regions. However, with continuing increases in deer numbers it is to be expected that such impacts will become more widespread.},

abstract = {(1) The relationship between male aggressive behaviour and population variables in the bank vole, Clethrionomys glareolus (Schreber, 1780), was investigated using two large (550 m2) field enclosures. (2) In a pilot experiment, castrated males survived as well as intact males over 22 weeks. (3) In a second experiment, populations of mixed age and sex were established in the enclosures. By castrating the majority of the founding males in the experimental enclosure, the overall level of aggressive behaviour was reduced with respect to the control enclosure, in which all the founding males were left intact; the starting densities in each enclosure were the same. (4) The number of voles in the experimental enclosure increased significantly faster than did the number in the control enclosure. The final density in both enclosures was much higher than commonly encountered in field populations. (5) The difference in numbers between the enclosures was due to a difference in the numbers of young animals entering the population. Mortality of juveniles between birth and first capture was significantly higher in the enclosure with all males intact than in the enclosure with castrates. (6) The degree of depression of reproduction of adult and immature animals of both sexes did not differ between enclosures, and in both enclosures it was markedly higher than in a field population. (7) Intact adult males showed more fresh wounds than all other age- and sex-classes, including the castrated males. (8) The enclosures eliminated the effects of immigration and emigration on the populations and the experiments allowed or controlled for outdoor environmental factors. The results, therefore, expose intrinsic factors of population regulation. The relevance of these findings to natural populations are discussed, with particular reference to the very high densities attained by the enclosed populations.},

abstract = {Eurasian beavers Castor fiber are potential hosts for a range of infectious diseases and parasites, including those typical of common European rodents. A number of infectious organisms are potentially zoonotic and may be notifiable under animal health legislation. The official trial beaver reintroductions to Scotland, the retrospectively licensed releases in England, and the increasingly obvious presence of large numbers of unlicensed illegally released animals have highlighted potential disease risks. We aimed to conduct a disease risk analysis, based on peer reviewed publications, for selection and health screening of Eurasian beavers prior to release into the wild in Britain. Adapted from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's 'Guidelines for Disease Risk Analysis', a four-step process was used to formulate a disease risk analysis: 1) problem description; 2) hazard identification based on literature review; 3) risk assessment, which resulted in categorisation of pathogens into low, medium, and high risk; and 4) risk management: identification of mitigating measures, followed by risk re-evaluation in light of the reported effectiveness of the mitigation measures. The highest-risk pathogens identified in the literature review process included: parasites, specifically Cryptosporidium parvum, Echinococcus multilocularis, Eimeria spp., Fasciola hepatica, Giardia spp., Trichinella britovi; bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli, Franciscella tularensis, Mycobacterium avium, Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp.; a fungus Chrysosporium parvum (Emmonsia parva); and terrestrial rabies virus. Most could be mitigated by sourcing beavers from Britain. The rest could be mitigated by pre-release testing procedures that are already established. The risk of introducing significant disease to humans, domestic animals, or wildlife by releasing into the wild in Britain a beaver that was captive-bred in Britain or a wild beaver from Scotland, based on the current evidence of disease incidence, and assuming the use of robust, peer reviewed, pre-release health screening techniques, can be viewed as low.},

The relative area of watercourses and tree lines in the landscape parks was the best predictor of bat activity. Landscape parks including unimproved grassland, water, parkland, semi-natural woodland, plantation woodland and tree lines have the most potential for foraging bats, and may form favourable 'islands' in intensively managed agricultural landscapes. To maximize the conservation value of historic landscape parks for bats, these habitats should be conserved or created.},

abstract = {Caves are an important resource to a large proportion of temperate bat species, primarily as mating and hibernation sites. However, information on bat use exists for only a small fraction of caves in many parts of the temperate world, in part because current survey methods are inappropriate for many species. We surveyed the UK's largest karst landscape, the Yorkshire Dales, by monitoring autumn swarming (mating) activity at 53 caves using automated echolocation call loggers, followed by trapping. Over 60% of caves surveyed were used by bats, but there was considerable variation in activity. Swarming activity was positively correlated with chamber development and negatively correlated with the amount of water the cave carried: together these two predictors explained 45% of the variance. Entrance orientation and shelter explained a further 10%. Activity was not correlated with entrance size, altitude or connectivity to the nearest summer habitat. All five resident swarming species were caught at most sites: Myotis brandtii, Myotis daubentonii, Mycitis mystacinus, Myotis nattereri and Plecotus auritus. Behaviour, species composition and sex and age ratios were typical of swarming reported in other studies. Bat populations and catchment sizes were large and despite the proximity of other suitable caves, bats showed high fidelity to single sites. our results show that the national importance of these caves has been overlooked. We suggest that survey for swarming activity is a quick and effective method of identifying underground bat sites and is likely to uncover many previously unknown and important sites throughout the temperate world.

We investigated winter reproduction in natural populations of 2 European rodents, the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). Analyses of our data indicate that winter breeding was due to nonresponsive phenotypes in both sexes.

Population genetic analyses provided no hint of assortative mating between the 2 phenotypes.},

title = {THE GROWTH, REPRODUCTION AND MORTALITY OF AN ENCLOSED POPULATION OF RED DEER (CERVUS-ELAPHUS) IN NORTHWEST ENGLAND},
journal = {Journal of Zoology},
volume = {213},
pages = {23-44},
abstract = {This paper considers the growth, reproduction and mortality of enclosed (400 years) red deer, Cervus elaphus L. (n = 250–300), in Lyme Park, Cheshire, England. The Park consists of woodland (116 ha), parkland (175 ha) and moorland (244 ha) habitats. It was privately owned until 1946. Culling to control deer numbers was first done in 1975, and these results cover the period 1975–83.

Stags and hinds were locally abundant. Densities of hinds varied from 30 km−2 in the park to 77 km−2 on the moor. Three bachelor herds of stags were present but overall the population was dominated by hinds (sex ratio > 3:1). Performance was generally unexceptional for this species in Britain. Growth rates of stags and hinds were especially poor on the moor (to 400 m). Calf to hind ratios were generally low (range 0‐20‐0‐34) but maxima (0.55–0.60) were recorded in woodland sites.

Conditions on the moor were severe during the winter due to the poor quality of herbage (Molinia dominated) and a lack of shelter. Calf mortality (1975–83) varied (10–30%) but was particularly high during the cold winters of 1978–79 and 1981–82. Population density and winter food were probably the two principal factors limiting the performance of deer on the moor. By contrast, growth rates of stags and hinds in the park were high. However, calf to hind ratios were surprisingly low (0.15–0.26). No explanation of this anomally was apparent but the effects of ‘stress’ cannot be ruled out. Parkland stags dominated the rut throughout the whole Park because of their superior size and status. Stags from the moor appeared to play no part in the rut.

Culling has reduced levels of natural mortality but further improvements in performance are unlikely to be achieved without a reduction in sheep stocks, some improvement in habitat and the provision of shelter. There may, however, be some merit in retaining a high population density in Lyme Park for conservation reasons. Parks provide unique opportunities for studying the behaviour and ecology of red deer. The effects of competition, parental investment and management can be studied without the inconvenience of immigration or emigration. The problems of managing small populations of deer are briefly discussed.},

title = {Later is better: optimal timing for walked activity surveys for a European bat guild},
journal = {Wildlife Biology},
volume = {21},

pages = {323-328},
abstract = {Bat activity surveys (walked surveys combining transect and point counts) are extremely important for collecting data throughout Europe in conservation and planning contexts. To ensure optimal data, it is vital to ensure synchronicity between survey time and peak bat activity. However, although protocols for two-hour dusk activity surveys are well accepted, recommended start time in relation to sunset is a 'best guess' rather than based on empirical evidence. Accepted practice differs widely with recommended start times varying from 30 min pre-sunset (finishing 90 min post-sunset) to 30 min post-sunset (finishing 2.5 h after sunset). We provide the first empirical test of optimal start times for dusk activity surveys by comparing bat activity at the same sites on the same nights. Four sites were surveyed, viz. two high-quality woodland sites and two low-quality agricultural sites. At each site, surveyors walked the same route and stopped at the same pre-defined listening points for three repeat surveys per night: 1) starting 30 min pre-sunset; 2) starting at sunset; and 3) starting 30 min post-sunset. In total, 240 hours' of data were collected. Four species, all widespread and common throughout Europe, were recorded: common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus, soprano pipistrelle P. pygmaeus, Natterer's Myotis nattereri and noctule Nyctalus noctule. Recorded bat activity was highest on sunset and post-sunset surveys both generally (overall bat activity) and for all specific species encountered. Findings were generally consistent for both low-and high-quality habitats. The same species were generally represented in both point and transect data but point data yielded higher estimates of overall activity in low-quality habitat and higher bat species richness in both high-and low-quality habitat relative to transect data. We recommend that: 1) two-hour dusk bat activity surveys start at/after sunset not before sunset and 2) both transect and point data are collected and analysed.},

journal = {Mammal Review},

abstract = {1. In order to conserve threatened species, knowledge of the status, trends and trajectories of populations is required. Co-ordinating collection of these data is challenging, especially for inconspicuous species such as the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius. 2. The UK National Dormouse Monitoring Programme (NDMP) is comprised of nest box recording schemes organised by volunteers. The number, size, and coverage of these schemes has varied over time. Such changes risk conflation of genuine population trends with covarying artefacts, including survey effort and expansion into sites of variable quality. 3. We provide a robust analysis of count data from 400 NDMP sites from 1993 to 2014 and demonstrate that changes in counts are not an artefact of survey characteristics. In relation to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria, we conclude that dormouse counts in nest boxes are an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon and allow the inference of population reduction of 72% (95% confidence intervals 62-79%) over the 22 years from 1993 to 2014, equivalent to a mean annual rate of decline of 5.8% (4.5-7.1%). This decline is ongoing. 4. We highlight difficulties in assigning an IUCN Red List conservation category to a population, given variation in apparent trends over consecutive time-periods. In eight out of 13 sliding window intervals of 10 years from 1993 to 2014, the 95% confidence intervals overlap a decline of 50%. While average population decline over 10-year periods suggests that the hazel dormouse should be classified as Vulnerable, a precautionary approach would not rule out the category of Endangered in the United Kingdom, given the lower bounds of population change estimates, the mean annual rate of decline and ongoing decline. 5. Ongoing decline in the hazel dormouse population is despite a high level of species protection and widespread conservation measures. The hazel dormouse is a UK Biodiversity Action Plan Priority Species and a European Protected Species, and the causes of population reduction are not well understood and may not have ceased. An urgent appraisal of dormouse conservation is required to ensure the species' favourable conservation status.},

abstract = {Although strictly protected, populations of the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius in the UK declined by 72% from 1993 to 2014. Using National Dormouse Monitoring Programme data from 300 sites throughout England and Wales, we investigated variation in hazel dormouse population status (expressed as Indices of Abundance, Breeding, and population Trend) in relation to climate, landscape, habitat, and woodland management. Dormice were more abundant and produced more litters on sites with warmer, sunnier springs, summers, and autumns. Dormouse abundance was also higher on sites with consistently cold local climate in winter. Habitat connectivity, woodland species composition, and active site management were all correlated with greater dormouse abundance and breeding. Abundances were also higher on sites with successional habitats, whereas the abundance of early successional bramble Rubus fruticosus habitat, woodland area, and landscape connectivity were important for population stability. Diversity in the structure of woodlands in Europe has decreased over the last 100years, and the habitats we found to be associated with more favourable dormouse status have also been in decline. The conservation status of the hazel dormouse, and that of woodland birds and butterflies, may benefit from reinstatement or increased frequency of management practices, such as coppicing and glade management, that maintain successional and diverse habitats within woodland.},

volume = {82},

abstract = {Freshwater gastropods often contribute significantly to freshwater ecosystem biomass and are a vital component of many consumers' diets. They can also serve as a nutrient resource for terrestrial predators, representing an important example of nutrient transfer across a habitat boundary. This study uses bankside middens to provide evidence of predation by the brown rat Rattus norvegicus on the native freshwater gastropod Viviparus viviparus in a closed, lentic system in Ely, southeastern England. Conchological analysis of shell remains in middens compared with live snails in adjacent water sites suggested this predation could be size-selective for larger snails, and analysis of soft tissue dry weights and the mechanical force required to break shells suggested that this was driven predominantly by maximizing nutrient gain, rather than by optimizing handling effort. Aquatic gastropods represent a potentially important nutrient resource for brown rat populations; this resource may be used continuously through time or exhibit 'resource pulse' dynamics. Predation of this nature might also have important impacts on gastropod population structure, which may in turn impair ecosystem functioning.},

pages = {316-325},
abstract = {1The mammal fauna of the British Isles has seen major perturbations since the end of the last ice age, some natural and some anthropogenic. Today, 61 species of terrestrial mammals breed in the British Isles, but only 39 of them are native species, the rest have been introduced. Furthermore, 19 native species have disappeared from the fauna including all the large predators, lynx Lynx lynx, wolf Canis lupus and brown bear Ursus arctos. 2Inevitably, these changes in species composition have been accompanied by major changes in community function including changes in patterns of energy flow through the mammalian community. For example, a high percentage of all the energy now flows through the introduced rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus population and red deer Cervus elaphus, which, in the absence of natural predators, are living at extremely high densities. 3Could the reintroduction of species help to reverse such changes in community structure and function? The successful return to the wild of species such as the Arabian oryx Oryx leucoryx and beaver Castor fiber has shown that reintroductions are certainly possible. However, the impact on community function of returned species is more difficult to evaluate. 4This question is addressed in relation to the consequences for deer populations of any possible reintroduction of the wolf to Scotland. Based on what we know of wolves elsewhere, predictions are made about the likely demography and patterns of killing behaviour of introduced wolves. These values are then used to parameterize a Leslie matrix simulation of the impact of wolves on contemporary populations of red deer in Scotland. The simulations suggest very strongly that wolves are very unlikely to have any significant impact on the high-density populations of deer now living in the Scottish landscape.},

This paper describes the comparative ecology of woodmice living in two habitats of markedly different productivity; deciduous woodland and a maritime sand-dune system. The diets of the two populations were quite different; woodland mice ate mainly seeds whilst those on the dunes subsisted on invertebrates, particularly Coleoptera. Population densities in the woodland were higher than those on the dunes. In contrast, home range sizes were much larger on the dunes. Mice living in the two habitats exhibited different patterns of activity. The dune animals left their nests earlier in the evening and they were active for longer each night. It is argued that all of these differences between the two populations are due to differences in food availability in the two habitats.},

Here we explore the trade-off between shortterm achievement of high social status and longer-term life history costs in animals which vary in competitive ability. Using laboratory mice, Mus musculus, as a model system, we show that small competitors can initially maintain dominance over larger males by increasing investment in olfactory status signalling (scent-marking), but only at the cost of reduced growth rate and body size. As a result they become more vulnerable to dominance reversals later in life. Our results also provide the first empirical information about life history costs of olfactory status signals.},

abstract = {Wild boar Sus scrofa has been extinct in Britain for several centuries. Recently, however, some conservationists have argued that it should be reintroduced. Here, we report that two populations of free-living wild boar are already present in Britain, in the south of England, ranging over areas of approximately 15 km(2) in the county of Dorset and 175 km 2 in the counties of Kent and East Sussex. Presence of the animals was indicated initially by unsolicited reports to the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs, and was confirmed by searching the relevant areas for field signs such as tracks, faeces, nests and rooted areas. Six carcasses of road-killed or shot animals were available for inspection from the Kent/East Sussex area and had the morphological characteristics of wild boar. Breeding was confirmed in the Kent/East Sussex area and is suspected in the Dorset population. A simple population dynamics model, based on an estimated initial population of 100 animals, suggests a growth rate, r, of between 0.016 and 0.267 for the Kent/East Sussex population. We conclude that the Kent/East Sussex population is likely to prove viable unless actively persecuted, and discuss the social, agricultural, ecological and conservational implications.},

abstract = {Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) populations are expanding across Europe. Depending on location, beaver dams bring multiple benefits and/or require management. Using nationally available data, we developed: a Beaver Forage Index (BFI), identifying beaver foraging habitat, and a Beaver Dam Capacity (BDC) model, classifying suitability of river reaches for dam construction, to estimate location and number of dams at catchment scales. Models were executed across three catchments, in Great Britain (GB), containing beaver. An area of 6747 km(2) was analysed for BFI and 16,739 km of stream for BDC. Field surveys identified 258 km of channel containing beaver activity and 89 dams, providing data to test predictions. Models were evaluated using a categorical binomial Bayesian framework to calculate probability of foraging and dam construction. BFI and BDC models successfully categorised the use of reaches for foraging and damming, with higher scoring reaches being preferred. Highest scoring categories were ca. 31 and 79 times more likely to be used than the lowest for foraging and damming respectively. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression showed that modelled dam capacity was significantly related (p = 0.01) to observed damming and was used to predict numbers of dams that may occur. Estimated densities of dams, averaged across each catchment, ranged from 0.4 to 1.6 dams/km, though local densities may be up to 30 dams/km. These models provide fundamental information describing the distribution of beaver foraging habitat, where dams may be constructed and how many may occur. This supports the development of policy and management concerning the reintroduction and recolonisation of beaver.},

abstract = {1. The delayed density-dependent predation of specialists such as weasels (Mustela nivalis L.) may result in cycles in the abundance of their prey. We estimated the demographic impact of weasel predation on field-vole (Microtus agrestis L.) survival using capture-recapture data from a large-scale, replicated predator-manipulation experiment conducted in six unfenced populations in Kielder Forest, northern England. The density of weasels was experimentally reduced through continuous live-trapping in the three removal populations. Field-vole survival was compared between paired removal and control populations during the increase, peak and decline phases of a vole population cycle. Apparent survival and recapture probabilities were estimated using open population Cormack-Jolly Seber models. 2. Field-vole survival varied extensively both spatially between populations and temporally, being highest in the late autumn and over winter and lowest each year in spring and early summer. Patterns of variation in male and female survival were similar between populations over time, but there was independent spatial and temporal variation between adults and juveniles. Variation in weasel abundance explained 18% of this independent spatial and temporal variation between adult and juvenile field-vole survival. 3. The average increase in annual vole survival resulting from weasel removal over the 2-year period was 27% and 25% for adult male and female field voles, respectively. Decreased weasel abundance increased adult field-vole survival. Adult-vole survival in the absence of weasels was predicted to be approximately 8% higher than in the presence of one weasel per 4-5 ha. Surprisingly, weasel removal resulted in lowered juvenile field-vole survival, possibly reflecting increased emigration or mortality due to infanticide. A simple two age-class demographic model indicated that the decrease in juvenile survival in response to reduced weasel predation pressure did not fully compensate for the increase in adult survival. 4. As weasel numbers fluctuated seasonally, with highest weasel densities occurring in late summer and autumn and little spring to spring variation, the impact of weasel removal on field-vole survival was greatest during the breeding season. However, vole population-growth rates were unrelated to adult survival at that time and correspondingly no divergence was observed between the trajectories of control and removal vole populations even when weasel numbers were greatest in control sites. In contrast, vole population-growth rates were closely correlated with survival during the non-breeding season. Nevertheless all control and removal populations experienced a cyclic decline in winter 1999-2000 in spite of the increased adult survival in experimental treatments. 5.

abstract = {1. The delayed density-dependent predation of specialists such as weasels (Mustela nivalis L.) may result in cycles in the abundance of their prey. We estimated the demographic impact of weasel predation on field-vole (Microtus agrestis L.) survival using capture-recapture data from a large-scale, replicated predator-manipulation experiment conducted in six unfenced populations in Kielder Forest, northern England. The density of weasels was experimentally reduced through continuous live-trapping in the three removal populations. Field-vole survival was compared between paired removal and control populations during the increase, peak and decline phases of a vole population cycle. Apparent survival and recapture probabilities were estimated using open population Cormack-Jolly Seber models. 2.

abstract = {Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) may conflict with humans using fish stocks for food, income or recreation. Understanding fish selection by otters is important for predicting and managing potential conflicts. We used spraint analysis to describe the diet of Eurasian otters on rivers in the Upper Thames Valley, lowland England, in summer and winter, focusing specifically on the species and size of fish consumed. We assessed the proportion of fish consumed that were of potential commercial or sporting value (the 'Potential Value' category). Within this group, we assessed relative selection for family and length by comparing fish found in otter diet with their local availability. Local availability was estimated from UK Environment Agency electrofishing survey data. Fish represented 46 % (relative frequency of occurrence, RFO) of total otter diet, with fish of Potential Value representing 19 % (RFO). In the Potential Value category, cyprinids were relatively avoided; percids and esocids were relatively preferred. Most (similar to 80 %) fish prey items originated from fish 4-13 cm in length, 3 % from fish > 20 cm. Smaller (0-10 cm) percids and cyprinids, and larger (16-20 cm) esocids, were preferred. In summer, diet was broad, comprising 31 % (RFO) fish, 24 % birds and 14 % crayfish. In winter, diet was predominantly fish (68 % RFO) with crayfish and birds accounting for similar to 5 % each. In summer, most fish consumed (70 % RFO) were the relatively slow-swimming common bullhead (Cottus gobio). Significantly more of the faster-swimming cyprinids were consumed in winter, presumably because they are easier to catch when the water is colder.},

journal = {Biological Conservation},
volume = {130},

pages = {239-250},
abstract = {Predicting the occurrence of species is an essential part of conservation biology. The range of techniques used to do this has increased in recent years. This has included wider use of information-theoretic approaches; particularly Akaike's information criteria (AIC). AIC is often used with regression modelling when predicting species distribution. The traditional method of model selection in regression modelling, stepwise significance testing, is also still widely used. This paper compares the two approaches, using the occurrence of the dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) in Cumbria, UK as an example. The dormouse is a protected species whose abundance and range have declined nationally Knowledge of its occurrence in Cumbria is required in order to increase measures for its conservation in the area. The paper uses the habitat features woodland size, altitude, soil type, tree species present, temperature and rainfall as potential predictors. As only presence data was available for dormice in Cumbria, pseudo-absences were generated to allow logistic regression modelling. The use of pseudo-absences was justified using a false record permutation test. Cross-validation allowed the ability of models to predict the data to be assessed. This was judged using ROC plots. The size of the wood, temperature and whether the soil was wet or dry were the best predictors of dormouse incidence in Cumbria. The two approaches produced different models; those from the information-theoretic approach had a better ability to fit the data. The information-theoretic approach also had the advantage of enabling model averaging and provided greater understanding of the system. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Both badgers and livestock movements have been implicated in contributing to the ongoing epidemic of bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in British cattle. However, the relative contributions of these and other causes are not well quantified. We used cattle movement data to construct an individual ( premises)-based model of BTB spread within Great Britain, accounting for spread due to recorded cattle movements and other causes. Outbreak data for 2004 were best explained by a model attributing 16% of herd infections directly to cattle movements, and a further 9% unexplained, potentially including spread from unrecorded movements. The best-fit model assumed low levels of cattle-to-cattle transmission. The remaining 75% of infection was attributed to local effects within specific high-risk areas. Annual and biennial testing is mandatory for herds deemed at high risk of infection, as is pre-movement testing from such herds. The herds identified as high risk in 2004 by our model are in broad agreement with those officially designated as such at that time. However, border areas at the edges of high-risk regions are different, suggesting possible areas that should be targeted to prevent further geographical spread of disease. With these areas expanding rapidly over the last decade, their close surveillance is important to both identify infected herds quickly, and limit their further growth.},

Wood mice were trapped in the open fields throughout the year and their burrows were also found there. Population densities were comparable with those reported from deciduous woodland and seasonal population changes, ranging behaviour and timing of the breeding season were also broadly similar. The survival rate of juvenile mice varied greatly within and between breeding seasons tending to improve when young of the year replaced overwintered animals in the adult breeding population. Wood mice showed no marked preference for fields with different crops in winter when the main foods were grain, waste sugar beet roots, weed seeds and soil invertebrates. In spring and early summer they preferred winter wheat fields where seeding weeds provided most of their food.},

abstract = {A survey of 96 sites in a range of riparian habitats in the catchments of five rivers during June-August 1998 used the bait tube method to investigate the geographical distribution and habitat occurrence of Water Shrews (Neomys fodiens) in the Weald of South-East England. Water Shrews were found at 42%, of sites, and were widely distributed in all river catchments except the Mole. They occurred in many riparian habitats, including rivers, streams, canals and ditches, with a range of physical and biotic characteristics. There were no signs of habitat avoidance in response to human disturbance but Water Shrews were absent from the river catchment with lowest water quality. Logistic regression analysis was used to model the effect of habitat variables on the presence of Water Shrews., with current speed, water depth, bank incline and bank-side vegetation identified as important variables. Fast-flowing shallow waters had a significant positive effect on their presence, whereas scarce herbaceous vegetation and a bank of low incline had a significant negative effect. These habitat variables appear to be reliable indicators of the probability of finding Water Shrews at a particular site, and have implications for habitat management and conservation.},

abstract = {An unmanaged population of Soay sheep living on Hirta, St Kilda, Scotland is persistently unstable, fluctuating between about 600 and 1600 individuals. Population crashes occurring approximately every 3 years are primarily due to winter food shortage. In this paper we show that sheep experimentally relieved of their gastrointestinal nematodes (predominantly Teladorsagia spp.) survived a crash better than matched controls, showing that nematode parasites contribute to the probability that a sheep dies in a crash. We also show that over three successive crashes mortality was significantly different between individuals of the three different genotypes at the diallelic adenosine deaminase locus (Ada). FF animals were most likely to die, SS animals had an intermediate probability of dying, and FS animals were least likely to die. Finally, three independent lines of evidence suggest that nematode burdens differ between the three Ada genotypes. First, in August, heterozygous females are less likely to have nematode eggs in their faeces than homozygous females. Second, at lambing, the periparturient rise in faecal egg count was highest in homozygous FF individuals. Finally, during the Autumn mating season, heterozygous males has lower faecal egg counts than homozgyotes, although this relation was complicated by interactions with year and age of male. These results are consistent with the idea that Ada allele frequencies are maintained in the sheep population by parasite-associated selection.},

abstract = {(1) Wood mice were trapped six times between January 1971 and January 1972 on two areas in an oak woodland in Devon. (2) Capture-mark-recapture studies on a control plot confirmed previous studies that populations exhibit an annual cycle in numbers with peak densities in winter and low densities in the summer. (3) Early in 1971 densities were extraordinarily high and breeding had continued well into the winter; this was associated with a very good acorn crop in 1970. In contrast the acorn crop failed in 1971, breeding ended in October and the winter population in January 1972 was small. (4) Survival deteriorated in the spring after the onset of breeding. By August 96% of the founder members of the breeding population had disappeared. Juvenile survival was poor in the spring and summer but improved in the early autumn. (5) Wood mice captured on an experimental plot were removed to the laboratory for behavioural studies. Home cage and neutral cage dyadic encounters were staged to study behavioural interaction. (6) Neutral cage interaction was highest in winter and lowest in summer and autumn; the converse was seen in home cage encounters. (7) A peak in agonistic behaviour was seen between home cage males in May; at other times the behaviour in home cage and neutral cage encounters was amicable. (8) This increase in male-male home cage interaction in May is linked with a space-associated intolerance by males towards conspecifics at this time of the year. (9) Changes in male-male interaction are related to changes in adult and juvenile survival, and social organization during the spring, summer and autumn. It is concluded that these relationships play an important part in the natural regulation of wood mouse numbers.},

abstract = {1. The population ecology of grey squirrels Sciurus carolinensis living in a 9-ha oak Quercus robur wood in southern England was studied between 1976 and 1987 using live-trapping techniques. Trapping was carried out in winter, spring and summer. The availability of tree seeds during the autumn of each year, and the severity of cold weather over each winter were also measured to examine their effects on squirrel population dynamics. 2. Capture probabilities of squirrels in winter, and to a lesser extent in spring, were inversely related to food availability and data from these two seasons were not considered dependable. The analyses concentrated on the summer populations. 3. The long-term average summer density of squirrels was high at 8.8 ha(-1) (SE 3.41 ha(-1)) demonstrating that the oak wood was high quality habitat for grey squirrels. Over 10 of the 12 years, summer densities were remarkably similar, ranging between 7 ha(-1) and 10 ha(-1) (mean 8.5 ha(-1), SE 0.95 ha(-1)). However, numbers were driven upwards in 1977 to a density approaching 18 ha(-1) and downwards in 1982 to a density of about 3 ha(-1): a 6-fold difference. 4. In good seed years, breeding starts in December, in poor seed years the start of breeding is deferred until the spring. There was no or very little spring breeding in 5 years when food supplies were poor. Female reproductive success was positively associated with food availability. Partial correlation analysis showed that the level of association was not improved when the effects of winter weather were taken into account. The number of new adult females in the summer population was positively associated with food availability but there was no association between new males and food. This suggests that food availability is more important to breeding females than breeding males. 5. Persistence from summer to winter was positively associated with food availability, but persistence from summer to spring and to the following summer were not. Partial correlation analyses showed that the severity of winter weather tended to mask the effects of food availability on persistence and the partial correlation coefficients were higher when the effects of weather were held constant. Adult females had the highest persistence between summers (52%, n = 11, SE 6%), followed by juvenile females (38%, n = 7, SE 8%), adult males (36%, n = 11, SE 4%), and juvenile males (21%, n = 7, SE 7%). The persistence of adult males but not females was inversely related to the initial number of males present. 6. In males, there was no significant difference in winter body mass between years and winter body mass was not associated with food availability, although there were very few data for winters when the food supply was good. In 7 years when the food supply was poor to moderate, there was an increase in mean body mass between summer and winter in 4 years, and a decrease in 3 years. 7. The data were explored using ordination techniques; first a standardized principal component analysis and then the canonical form of principal component analysis or redundancy analysis. The analysis was carried out on years derived from MNA of males and females and various combinations of the environmental variables: food availability (FOOD) and the severity of winter weather (TEMP). The ordination biplots clearly showed the high correlation between MNA males and MNA females and that FOOD was the most important environmental variable. TEMP on its own had no effect but FOOD x TEMP was important. 8. Following on the exploratory data analysis and for predictive purposes, a general linear model between the numbers of squirrels in the summer populations and sex, FOOD and FOOD x TEMP as explanatory variables accounted for 77% the variance in squirrel numbers among years. 9. This study shows that tree seed availability is the most important factor limiting grey squirrel densities, but this factor both positively and negatively interacts with the severity of winter weather to affect grey squirrel population dynamics.},

abstract = {A model of habitat suitability linked to a Geographic Information System was developed for the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) in 2800 ha of Thetford Forest, East England, to assess red squirrel population numbers in relation to forest management. We defined each forest sub-compartment or parcel of land in terms of its tree species and age between 1995 and 2015, and categorised each parcel of land as low, moderate or high red squirrel suitability. Resident squirrels may live in more than one habitat patch providing the distance between patches is within the foraging range of the animals and the land between the patches does not act as a barrier to foraging movements. Moreover, squirrels require a minimum area (home range area) of suitable habitat that will provide them with sufficient food resources. To examine these two factors, we explored 120 different model scenarios using three different distances to link patches together and four different sized minimum areas, termed minimum linked areas (MLA), that would hold resident red squirrels, at five year intervals between 1995 and 2015. As an overall measure of suitability, we summed all the MLAs in the reserve for high plus moderate suitability, which we have called the total linked area (TLA), and forecast how this may change in the future. We show that TLA will increase from 39% in 1995 to 67% of the study area by 2015, demonstrating that the reserve will get better for red squirrels over this time. We also demonstrate how changes in forest management would further increase TLA to 82% by 2015. Our results demonstrate how a habitat suitability model operating at the scale of an individual forest, coupled with a GIS and based on an understanding of the species' ecology, provides an objective way of assessing the impact of forest management prescriptions on red squirrel populations.

abstract = {In the UK, alien grey squirrels have been replacing the native red squirrel for more than 100 years and by the turn of the century the distribution of grey squirrels had extended to most of central and southern England and Wales (apart from some islands), and large parts of Scotland and Ireland. To understand how this species replacement may continue into the future, we explore 20 years of squirrel records (1991-2010) collected in an unsystematic way by volunteers in northern England and Scotland. To aid analysis, we standardised the data to one record of squirrel presence per 4 km square per year in each of six geographic regions, two in northern England and four in Scotland. Over the 20 years and across all regions, the number of 4 km squares that returned the presence of squirrels increased from 23% to 80%. The evolving distribution pattern of red and grey squirrels differed among the regions and was complex with occupancy records for many 4 km squares changing from red to grey squirrel from one year to the next, but also some changing from grey to red squirrel. The net rate of change, however, was from red to grey squirrel with the exception of the more recent years, 2007-2010, when this trend became less distinct. Estimates of the complete loss of red squirrels assuming current trends, varied from the 2020s in northern England to 2104 in North East Scotland. The recent incertitudes in the replacement of red by grey squirrels may, at least in part, result from increasing efforts to control grey squirrels in these regions. Although the volunteer data presented are valuable, monitoring aims must be clearly defined and sampling designs involving volunteers and professionals must be systematic and of sufficient effort to obtain reliable information on changes in distribution and population trends.},

abstract = {1. In Britain, five indirect methods have been used to survey for the presence of red Sciurus vulgaris and grey squirrels S. carolinensis and to monitor population trends through time. These are: visual counts along line transects, the use of hair tubes, counts of dreys, cone line feeding transects in conifer forests and feeding signs on whole maize bait at feeding stations. 2. Drey counts and cone feeding transects cannot differentiate between red and grey squirrels and are not suitable for areas where both species may be present. Hair tubes require expertise and facilities to identify hairs to species, and the relationship between tube visits and animal density in different habitats is only known for red squirrels in Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis dominated plantations. Visual counts along line transects are the simplest method to do and require little equipment. However, in general, few squirrels are seen in a single count which leads to difficulties in estimating densities. 3. In this paper we present data from several studies carried out in Britain to illustrate the type of data that may be collected, and to evaluate their accuracy and precision with which they could detect population change. Hair tube lines and drey counts required the fewest number of samples to detect population change. When effort was also considered, visual transects and drey counts were more economical. However, none of the monitoring methods discussed is very precise and it may be best to monitor squirrels only in terms of relative changes in numbers or indices of numbers through time. 4. Our results for red and grey squirrels also illustrated that the number of samples required to detect population change is likely to differ according to the size of the survey area. Monitoring programmes should therefore be carefully planned in relation to spatial scale in order to be able to detect real population changes. Species-specific, quantitative thresholds to determine the significance of detected declines may need to be established for threatened UK mammals and assessed in relation to what would constitute a significant decline and whether it requires management intervention.},

journal = {Biological Conservation},
volume = {131},

pages = {287-295},
abstract = {Squirrel poxvirus (SQPV) is a well-documented example of pathogen-mediated competition between an invasive species, the grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), and a native species, the Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). SQPV causes disease with high mortality in red squirrels but appears non-pathogenic in grey squirrels. Not all populations of introduced grey squirrels carry the virus, notably those in Scotland and Italy, and the rate of red squirrel replacement by grey squirrels is some twenty times faster in those areas where grey squirrels carry the virus. Here we develop strategies to manage the SQPV disease threat to red squirrels by reference to the largest, designated red squirrel refuge site in England, Kielder Forest (50000 ha). Using modelling techniques, we identify four main corridors within the buffer zone by which grey squirrels will reach Kielder, initially within two years and in large numbers within 10 years. Assuming that greys will not settle within Kielder because of the unfavourable nature of the spruce habitat, we predict that SQPV disease will burn out at the edges of the forest, although many red squirrels will die. This burn-out is unlikely to be the scenario in other refuge areas where the habitat is more favourable to greys. We conclude that the conservation of red squirrels will depend on minimising contact between red and grey squirrel populations, and we advocate monitoring grey squirrels in corridors within buffer zones around refuge areas, and removing them when detected.

abstract = {1. Throughout much of Britain, Ireland and north Italy, red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris L.) have been replaced by alien grey squirrels (S. carolinensis Gmelin) introduced from North America. We have studied squirrels in two mixed woodlands in north Italy and two conifer forests in north England. In each country, one site was occupied by red squirrels and one site by both species. 2. We have previously considered interference competition and exploitation competition for food and space between red and grey squirrels and have showed that grey squirrels caused reduced body growth in juvenile and subadult red squirrels, and compete for tree seeds cached by adult red squirrels in spring. Here we report on the effects of grey squirrels on three fitness components in red squirrels that have consequence at the population level: fecundity, residency and recruitment. 3. Litter production peaked in the spring and summer, but fewer females bred in the summer with grey squirrels present. In addition, fewer individual red squirrel females produced two litters per year in the sites with grey squirrels. Moreover, red squirrel recruitment rate and, in the mixed broadleaf sites, red squirrel juvenile residency, decreased with increasing grey squirrel density. 4. Fecundity of individual female red squirrels was lower in red-grey than in red-only sites because they had a lower body mass in sites with grey squirrels. 5. Overall, there was no significant effect of grey squirrels on residency of adult red squirrels or on population turnover rate. However, the presence of grey squirrels resulted in a reduction in red squirrel fitness which was evident by lower population summer breeding and a lower recruitment. Over time, this will result in a decline in population size and eventually population extinction.},

abstract = {As the global population urbanizes, dramatic changes are expected in city lighting and the urban form, which may threaten the functioning of urban ecosystems and the services they deliver. However, little is known about the ecological impact of lighting in different urban contexts. Movement is an important ecological process that can be disrupted by artificial lighting. We explored the impact of lighting on gap crossing for Pipistrellus pipistrellus, a species of bat (Chiroptera) common within UK cities. We aimed to determine whether the probability of crossing gaps in tree cover varied with crossing distance and lighting level, through stratified field surveys. We then used the resulting data on barrier thresholds to model the landscape resistance due to lighting across an entire city and explored the potential impact of scenarios for future changes to street lighting. The level of illumination required to create a barrier effect reduced as crossing distance increased. For those gaps where crossing was recorded, bats selected the darker parts of gaps. Heavily built parts of the case study city were associated with large and brightly lit gaps, and spatial models indicate movement would be highly restricted in these areas. Under a scenario for brighter street lighting, the area of accessible land cover was further reduced in heavily built parts of the city. We believe that this is the first study to demonstrate how lighting may create resistance to species movement throughout an entire city. That connectivity in urban areas is being disrupted for a relatively common species raises questions about the impacts on less tolerant groups and the resilience of bat communities in urban centres. However, this mechanistic approach raises the possibility that some ecological function could be restored in these areas through the strategic dimming of lighting and narrowing of gaps.},

abstract = {British red squirrel populations have been subject to landscape management practices resulting in large-scale fragmentation and defragmentation of habitat, as well as numerous historical introductions of closely related subspecies. This unique population history allowed us to examine: (1) the morphological changes to a rare native species probably caused by hybridization with introduced subspecies; (2) the impact of landscape management, specifically reforestation, on the spread of these morphological changes across the north of England. British red squirrels represent a peripheral population of Sciurus vulgaris, which is regarded as a separate subspecies (S. v. leucourus) to populations found on the European continent. British populations are in danger of extinction because of the introduction of the North American grey squirrel S. carolinensis. Repeated translocation of continental European S. vulgaris individuals to Britain over 150 years may be responsible for an alteration of the morphological characteristics of populations compared to the original subspecies description. The majority of examined populations possessed the coat colour characteristics associated with continental European subspecies. Only populations in the western region of Cumbria possessed coat colour characteristics similar to the described subspecies S. v. leucourus. Changes to landscape connectivity in Britain during the 1980s greatly altered dispersal patterns, resulting in an increase of gene flow from populations in the north-east of England and the Borders into Cumbria. The morphological characteristics of the Cumbrian population also changed over this period, from traits similar to the British subspecies before 1980, to traits similar to the continental European subspecies after 1980. This study demonstrates the threat landscape management practices and the introduction of closely related subspecies can present to rare peripheral populations.},

abstract = {Culling wildlife as a form of disease management can have unexpected and sometimes counterproductive outcomes. In the UK, badgers Meles meles are culled in efforts to reduce badger-to-cattle transmission of Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (TB). However, culling has previously been associated with both increased and decreased incidence of M. bovis infection in cattle. The adverse effects of culling have been linked to cull-induced changes in badger ranging, but such changes are not well-documented at the individual level. Using GPS-collars, we characterized individual badger behaviour within an area subjected to widespread industry-led culling, comparing it with the same area before culling and with three unculled areas. Culling was associated with a 61% increase (95% CI 27%-103%) in monthly home range size, a 39% increase (95% CI 28%-51%) in nightly maximum distance from the sett, and a 17% increase (95% CI 11%-24%) in displacement between successive GPS-collar locations recorded at 20-min intervals. Despite travelling further, we found a 91.2 min (95% CI 67.1-115.3 min) reduction in the nightly activity time of individual badgers associated with culling. These changes became apparent while culls were ongoing and persisted after culling ended. Expanded ranging in culled areas was associated with individual badgers visiting 45% (95% CI 15%-80%) more fields each month, suggesting that surviving individuals had the opportunity to contact more cattle. Moreover, surviving badgers showed a 19.9-fold increase (95% CI 10.8-36.4-fold increase) in the odds of trespassing into neighbouring group territories, increasing opportunities for intergroup contact. Synthesis and applications. Badger culling was associated with behavioural changes among surviving badgers which potentially increased opportunities for both badger-to-badger and badger-to-cattle transmission of Mycobacterium bovis. Furthermore, by reducing the time badgers spent active, culling may have reduced badgers' accessibility to shooters, potentially undermining subsequent population control efforts. Our results specifically illustrate the challenges posed by badger behaviour to cull-based TB control strategies and furthermore, they highlight the negative impacts culling can have on integrated disease control strategies.},

They have been responsible for middens characterized by a distinct microspatial assemblage of plant species, in which common mesic species are favoured. They have benefited conservation through producing spatial heterogeneity of the spoil surface - thus increasing the number of available ecological niches. They have also mediated an importation of plant nutrients so gradual that competitive ruderal species have (with the exception of Ragwort, Senecio jacobaea) not been encouraged, whilst some desirable 'rabbit-resistant' species have become established particularly on the middens. 'Normal grazing' is a behavioural pattern which can maintain a sward, even when potentially dominating mesic species become established. However, 'casual grazing', and browsing, of conspicuous or rare plants, is likely to be disadvantageous. Manipulation of intrinsically unpredictable seral quarry floras through interference by Rabbit populations, or with Rabbit-access, may be an option on such sites.},

abstract = {Providing food for wild birds is perhaps the most widespread intentional interaction between people and wildlife. In the UK, almost half of households feed wild birds, often as peanuts and seed supplied in hanging feeders. Such food is also taken by the introduced, invasive Grey Squirrel Sciurus carolinensis. Little is known of how Grey Squirrels utilise this resource and how they affect feeder use by wild birds. To assess this we recorded the numbers and time spent by animals visiting experimental feeding stations in suburban gardens, and also asked if exclusionary guards (to prevent Grey Squirrel access), food type (peanut, mixed seed), habitat and weather conditions influenced visits. Using automated cameras, we recorded 24,825 bird and 8577 Grey Squirrel visits. On average > 44% of the time feeders were utilised, they were being visited by Grey Squirrels. Grey Squirrel presence prevented birds from feeding at the same time ( > 99.99%). Feeders where Grey Squirrels were dominant were less likely to be visited by birds, even in their absence. Guards reduced Grey Squirrel use to a minimum on seed feeders, and by approximately half on peanut feeders. Squirrels, food type, guard status, habitat and rainfall all influenced bird activity and timing of feeder visits. Our work suggests that Grey Squirrels reduce the availability of supplementary food to wild birds, while gaining large volumes of food resources with corresponding benefits. Given the ubiquity of supplementary feeding, it is likely that this is an important resource for urban Grey Squirrels; feeder guards mitigate this effect.},

In recent years, there has been concern about possible changes in the suitability of the site for Redshank (Trigna totanus) due to sika deer (Cervus nippon) grazing. In order to assess these changes, 50 plots were established in three different locations: 20 in grazed areas, 20 in ungrazed areas and 10 fenced enclosures. Deer grazing was found to significantly affect structural and species diversity of the saltmarsh vegetation. Spartina anglica dominated in ungrazed areas whilst Salicornia ramosissima and, to a lesser extent, Puccinellia maritima dominated in grazed sites. In grazed areas the vegetation cover was significantly lower, as was vegetation height and volume. In addition, significant changes were observed in the root biomass, which was lower in grazed areas. Infaunal diversity was generally low throughout the survey area. However, significant variations were observed. Invertebrates abundance was more abundant in grazed plots than in ungrazed plots, and least abundant in fenced plots. The study indicated that in its current condition, localised areas of Arne saltmarsh do not provide adequate habitat requirements for Tringa totanus. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is an emblematic species for conservation, and its decline in the British Isles exemplifies the impact that alien introductions can have on native ecosystems. Indeed, red squirrels in this region have declined dramatically over the last 60 years due to the spread of squirrelpox virus following the introduction of the gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). Currently, red squirrel populations in Britain are fragmented and need to be closely monitored in order to assess their viability and the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The situation is even more dramatic in the South of England, where S. vulgaris survives only on islands (Brownsea Island, Furzey Island, and the Isle of Wight). Using the D-loop, we investigated the genetic diversity and putative ancestry of the squirrels from Southern England and compared them to a European dataset composed of 1,016 samples from 54 populations. We found that our three populations were more closely related to other squirrels from the British Isles than squirrels from Europe, showed low genetic diversity, and also harbored several private haplotypes. Our study demonstrates how genetically unique the Southern English populations are in comparison with squirrels from the continental European range. We report the presence of four private haplotypes, suggesting that these populations may potentially harbor distinct genetic lineages. Our results emphasize the importance of preserving these isolated red squirrel populations for the conservation of the species.},

Non-invasive genetic analysis of bat droppings collected at roosts could be very useful in this respect as a rapid, costefficient monitoring tool. We developed species-specific real-time PCR assays for 18 British and Irish bat species to enable non-invasive, large-scale distribution monitoring, which were then applied to a field survey in Ireland. One hundred and sixty-four DNA samples were collected from 95 bat roosts, of which 73% of samples were identified to species, and the resident bat species were identified at 89% of roosts. However, identification success varied between roost types, ranging from 22% for underground sites to 92% for bat boxes. This panel of DNA tests will be especially useful in cases where roosts contain multiple species, where the number of bats present is small, or bats are otherwise difficult to directly observe. The methodology could be applied to the surveillance of proposed development sites, post development mitigation measures, distribution surveys, bat box schemes and the evaluation of agri-environmental bat box schemes.

abstract = {The American mink Neovison vison in Great Britain is an invasive alien species, with significant impacts on native prey species. There have been suggestions that populations of mink in Britain have declined since the 1990s. Three nationwide data sets include data on mink distribution and abundance. Scat surveys and the National Game Bag Census suggest population declines, but the latter does not take account of survey effort (which may also have declined) and the former is misleading because there is evidence that mink change their marking behaviour in the presence of otters Lutra lutra. National Biodiversity Network data suggest an increase in mink numbers, but this can be explained by a concomitant increase in mammal recording. Although intra-guild competition between invasive mink and native otters is likely, there is no evidence that otters have caused a decline in mink numbers. There is little information on the impact of disease, or exposure to rodenticides, on wild mink - both warrant further attention. Eradication efforts can have an impact on mink populations, but currently neither implementation nor monitoring is sufficient to generate effects throughout Great Britain or to assess the impact of cumulative local and regional efforts. We conclude that it is not possible, on the basis of currently available data for Great Britain, to ascertain the status of mink or assess the underlying trend in their population. We stress the importance of collaboration, coordination, and record keeping (and sharing) in future, proper interpretation of existing data, and the use of alternative data sources. We call for greater, and better, effort in both mink management and monitoring of management in Great Britain.},

Three individuals had high levels of creatinine, urea and the liver enzymes, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatise and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Six of 12 mink tested positive for antibodies to T. gondii and 8 of 12 tested positive for antibodies to ADV; none tested positive for antibodies to CDV. No significant bacteria or parasites were detected in faecal samples. Post-mortem examinations in three cases showed no significant lesions but the fourth animal had Skrjabingylus nasicola nematodes in the nasal passages, lung lesions suggestive of adiaspiromycosis, cholangiohepatitis possibly indicative of Pseudamphistomum truncatum infection and tubulointerstitial nephritis associated with renal calculi.},

abstract = {Distribution data for elusive species are often based on detection of field signs rather than of the animal itself. However, identifying field signs can be problematic. We present here the results of a survey for American mink, Neovison vison, in the northern highlands of Scotland to demonstrate the importance of verifying field sign identification. Three experienced surveyors located scats, which they identified as mink scats, at seven of 147 sites surveyed and "possible" mink scats at a further 50 sites. Mitochondrial DNA was successfully extracted from 45 of 75 (60%) scats, collected from 31 of the 57 "positive" sites; sequencing of amplified DNA fragments showed that none of these scats was actually of mink origin. We consider the implications of erroneous survey data and the potential waste of resources and misdirection of conservation/management actions. We discuss potential methods that may be useful to verify field sign identification, including the use of DNA analysis, and stress that verification is crucial to ensure rigorous and reliable survey data.},

abstract = {Monitoring elusive species, which are 'difficult to study', often relies on the use of indirect indices to estimate relative abundance. It is important to know the accuracy of such indices and factors affecting it. For the American mink Mustela vison (an invasive species of conservation concern in the UK), we compare two indices of relative abundance: sign surveys (based on the detection of scats) and a new method based on the use of tracking plates on rafts. We found that raft surveys consistently performed better than did sign surveys and that estimates of relative abundance derived from both raft and sign surveys were linearly related to the number of individuals captured (but statistically significantly so only for raft surveys). Although both indices were highly correlated, there was considerable unexplained variation in the relationship between them. No statistically significant seasonal effects were detected for either method. Costs of the two methods were comparable after the first 2 years (based on four surveys per year), although raft surveys were more economical than were sign surveys in the longer term. In areas where polecats M. putorius are sympatric with mink, it will be important to develop methods to minimise confusion between the tracks of polecats and mink.},

journal = {Ecology},
volume = {90},
number = {5},
pages = {1207-1216},
abstract = {The American mink, Neovison vison, is an established, alien invasive species in the United Kingdom that originally colonized the country at a time when two native mustelids (otters, Lutra lutra, and polecats, Mustela putorius) were largely absent. Both of these species are now recovering their populations nationally. We compared the relative abundance and the behavior of mink in the 1990s and in the 2000s in an area of southern England where both otters and polecats were absent in the 1990s but reappeared in the intervening years. We found that mink were still abundant in the 2000s in the presence of otters and polecats, but that they appeared to have altered some aspects of their behavior. In accordance with previous studies, we found that mink consumed fewer fish in the presence of otters. We also found that mink were predominantly nocturnal in the 1990s (in the absence of competitors) but were predominantly diurnal in the 2000s (in the presence of competitors). We hypothesize that this temporal shift may be an avoidance mechanism allowing the coexistence of mink with the otter and the polecat, although we are unable to attribute the shift to one or the other species. We also found that mink in the presence of competitors weighed less but remained the same size, suggesting the possibility of a competitor-mediated decline in overall body condition. This is one of very few field studies demonstrating a complete temporal shift in apparent response to competitors. The implications of this study are that recovering otter populations may not lead to significant and long-term reductions in the number of invasive mink in the United Kingdom as has been suggested in the media, although we cannot exclude the possibility of a decline in mink in the longer-term.},

abstract = {The spatial organization of a species on a landscape is influenced, at lease in part, by the presence of sympatric competitors. Interspecific relationships can thus have direct effects on the carrying capacity of the landscape and have important implications for conservation. We investigated the spatial relationships and activity patterns of 2 similarly sized mustelids: the invasive American mink (Neovison vison) and the native European polecat (Mustela putorius) in lowlands in the United Kingdom. By radiotracking mink (n = 11) and polecats (n = 7) in autumn when individuals of both species hold stable home ranges, we found that individuals tended to have overlapping home ranges, both within and between species; and the size of overlap areas was similar, but generally small, within and between species (mean approximately 20%, although overlaps were higher among mink of opposite sexes). Mink shared their home ranges with 0.3-1.17 other mink (of both sexes) and 0.83-1.3 polecats; polecats shared their home ranges with 0.6-1.0 polecats were nocturnal and mink were predominantly diurnal. Our results are consistent with interspecific territoriality although we cannot distinguish between interspecific territoriality and niche differentiation. We suggest that there is habitat partioning between the 2 species, but that this is incomplete and that temporal partioning enables avoidance of interspecific neighbors within overlap areas. Niche partioning by distance from water and time of day when active probably facilitates coexistence in the short term, but it is unclear whether coexistence is stable year-round or in the long term.},

By comparing the mean litter size of samples 1–5, 6–10 and 11+ days old, no significant loss of individual mice within litters could be detected, although 12·3% of all litters died prior to weaning. This loss was predominantly of autumnal litters, cold and wet being important climatic factors that terminate the breeding season. Comparisons are made with data from other parts of the animal's range.},

abstract = {(1) Data on 1141 foxes from London and 1701 foxes from Bristol were used to describe the demography of two urban fox populations. These data were combined with the results of a mark-recapture study in Bristol and used to construct population models. The results demonstrate that the calculated parameters from the demographic study produce stable populations. (2) The structure and monthly mortality patterns of the two populations were compared. The total fox population for Bristol was 211 family groups; these comprised 716 adults producing 897 cubs per annum. Of these, 353 adults and 363 cubs survived to the following year. In London a comparable 211 family groups consisted of 578 adults producing 904 cubs per annum; of these, 263 adults and 315 cubs survived to the following year. (3) It is suggested that in London the fox control operations do not significantly reduce the number of fox family groups but reduce the total number of adult foxes and cubs in the population and hence mean family group size. In London, mortality rate in adults and cubs is higher than in Bristol, and a stable population is maintained by increased productivity. This is not achieved by altering litter size but by reducing the proportion of non-breeding vixens and the proportion of dog foxes in the cub and adult populations. (4) In Bristol the fox population structure remained constant irrespective of population density and hence habitat quality. Even in the most favourable urban habitats, when population density approached five fox family groups per square kilometre, sex ratio, productivity and mortality rates remained the same. (5) These data are discussed in relation to current ideas on fox social biology and to a rabies control campaign in an urban area.

These results were combined with a variety of demographic data describing the fox population to examine the dispersal behaviour of urban foxes. (2) Dispersal was protracted, but occurred principally amongst sub-adults; by the end of their second year, 72.7% of male cubs and 32.3% of female cubs had dispersed. Of animals first caught as adults, only 35.3% of males and 29.2% of females dispersed. Mean recovery distances were small, although occasional movements up to 18 km were recorded. (3) For males, mean age of recovery dead was significantly higher for non-dispersed than for dispersed animals. For both males and females, dispersed animals born near the city centre lived significantly longer than those born closer to the periphery of the city. In the population as a whole, there was no evidence of animals dispersing in a particular direction, but littermates were more likely to disperse in the same general direction. The effects of population density at the capture and recapture points on dispersal are described. (4) A discriminant analysis was used to compare dispersing and non-dispersing foxes, using five predictor variables. For males, small cubs from large litters were more likely to disperse. For females, those that dispersed came from large litters. Using a discriminant analysis and six predictor variables to compare foxes that dispersed further than or less than the mean distance, males that moved further were significantly smaller and born in areas of lower fox density, usually closer to the periphery of the city. (5) These results are discussed in relation to the costs and benefits of dispersal for a subadult fox.},

abstract = {Worldwide, there are more than 1100 species of the Order Chiroptera, 45 of which are present in Europe, and 16 in the UK. Bats are reservoirs of, or can be infected by, several viral diseases, including rabies virus strains (in the Lyssavirus genus). Within this genus are bat variants that have been recorded in Europe; European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1), European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2) and, four currently unclassified isolates. Since 1977, 783 cases of EBLVs (by isolation of viral RNA) have been recorded in Europe. EBLV-1 or EBLV-2 has been identified in 12 bat species, with over 95% of EBLV-1 infections identified in Eptesicus serotinus. EBLV-2 is associated with Myotis species (Myotis daubentonii and Myotis dasycneme). A programme of passive surveillance in the United Kingdom between 1987 and 2004 tested 4871 bats for lyssaviruses. Of these, four M. daubentonii (3.5796 of submitted M. daubentonii) were positive for EBLV-2. Potential bias in the passive surveillance includes possible over-representation of synanthropic species and regional biases caused by varying bat submission numbers from different parts of the UK. In 2003, active surveillance in the UK began, and has detected an antibody prevalence level of 1-5% of EBLV-2 in M. daubentonii (n = 350), and one bat with antibodies to EBLV-1 in E. serotinus (n = 52). No cases of live lyssavirus infection or lyssavirus viral RNA have been detected through active surveillance. Further research and monitoring regarding prevalence, transmission, pathogenesis and immunity is required to ensure that integrated bat conservation continues throughout Europe, whilst enabling informed policy decision regarding both human and wildlife health issues.

We develop an IPM model incorporating dormouse nest counts and offspring counts, which is data often recorded as a standard part of dormouse nest box monitoring. We found a significant improvement in precision in the estimation of demographic parameters using IPM compared to standard mark-recapture estimation. We discuss our results in the context of common dormouse conservation monitoring.},

abstract = {P>1. Culling wildlife hosts is often implemented as a management technique to control pathogen transmission from wildlife to domestic or other economically important animals. However, culling may have unexpected consequences, can be expensive and may have wider implications for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. 2. We assess the evidence that culling mountain hares Lepus timidus is an effective and practical way to control louping ill virus in red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus. 3. Evidence from the available literature is limited, restricting our ability to reliably assess the effectiveness of culling mountain hares to control ticks, louping ill virus, or increase red grouse densities. Furthermore, the information required to assess the cost-benefit of this management strategy is lacking. The population response of mountain hares to culling is not well understood and the possible effects on their conservation status and the upland ecosystem remain unexplored. 4. We conclude that there is no compelling evidence base to suggest culling mountain hares might increase red grouse densities. 5. Synthesis and applications. Widespread culling of wildlife is not necessarily effective in reducing disease or improving economic returns. The use of wildlife culls for disease control should be proposed only when: (i) the pathogen transmission cycle is fully understood with all host-vector interactions considered; (ii) the response of wildlife populations to culling is known; and (iii) cost-benefit analysis shows that increased revenue from reduced disease prevalence exceeds the cost of culling.},

It was concluded that the greatest risks of exotic disease incursion into the UK were associated with disease entering through the consumption of infected pork meat or meat products by either wild boar or domestic swine and thus the diseases of highest risk are classic swine fever, foot and mouth disease and Trichinella sp. It should be noted that much of the peer review publications used as the scientific evidence base for this assessment describes disease outbreaks in boar populations in countries which have the disease endemically or have been previously exposed to the disease. In the UK, disease may act differently as the UK population of boar will be na < ve to the exotic notifiable diseases.},

This pattern of diet selection may reflect differences in the chemical composition (and hence nutritional quality) between individual plants, and/or variability in the physical constraints on intake rate, such as plant structure. 2. An experiment was conducted to test the effects of environmental manipulations on the morphology and chemical composition of Sitka Spruce saplings, and to evaluate the consequences for herbivory by Red Deer, Fertilizing the trees increased tree height, branch span and leader length, twig width and needle width, and decreased the concentrations of total phenolics, condensed tannins, fibre and lignin but monoterpene content was not altered. Shading also reduced phenolic and tannin concentrations. 3. When the fertilized and shaded trees were offered to deer in feeding trials, the probability of a tree being visited by a deer and the biomass removed were influenced by tree morphological variables, as were the bite rate and intake rate of the deer. More biomass was removed from larger tries. 4. Once the effects of tree morphology had been taken into account, there was no effect of the fertilizer and shade treatments on deer browsing behaviour that could be attributed to changes in chemical composition of the trees, The relationship between intake rate and bite size at each tree varied between individual deer, but the functional response relationship between intake rate and bite size was not influenced by the treatments applied to the trees. 5. Tree morphology may have a larger influence on deer feeding behaviour than tree chemical composition.},

pages = {554-567},
abstract = {We investigated the daily food and water consumption of a captive colony of three brown long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus) for 51 d. The bats were kept in a free-flight enclosure exposed to the natural photoperiod and temperature during the winter (January to March 1991) at 57-degrees-N. Water was always available, but food was available only on some nights. The mean daily temperature inside a wooden box provided as a hibernaculum was positively correlated with and slightly elevated above (0.6-degrees-2.8-degrees-C) the mean daily temperature outside the box in the free-flight enclosure. The mean temperature inside the hibernaculum was 7.1-degrees-C and outside was 5.6-degrees-C. The mean relative humidity in the hibernaculum was 82% (range 67%-93%). The activity of the bats outside the hibernaculum was monitored by two Doppler radar units. The daily probability of an individual bat emerging from the hibernaculum was between 0.26 and 0.99. Emergence probability increased when there was food available and when it was warmer. The activity of the bats was strictly nocturnal, initial emergence occurring a mean of 64.4 min after sunset (n = 42, SD = 27.0 min). When denied access to food, the bats drank an average of 0.20 mL . bat-1 . night-1 on the nights that at least one emerged (n = 14 nights, SE = 0.05, range = 0.00-0.68). On warmer nights the bats were more active and ate and drank more than on colder nights. We suggest that typically in P. auritus winter flights may not be induced by the onset of starvation (and hence the need to feed) or by the onset of dehydration (and hence the need to drink). Rather, at typical winter temperatures P. auritus may fly frequently, almost daily, to try and ensure that neither energy nor water reserves approach critically low levels. Only during a prolonged cold period (mean night temperature < 4-degrees-C) might many days pass without a winter flight.},

The vegetation of the island was divided into nine categories and the habitat preferences of both rodent species assessed. These have remained distinct and, as in the previous survey, the voles were found to be most strongly associated with areas of deep bracken with little undercover and the mice with open areas such as cliff tops and rocky outcrops.

A crude survey of the distribution of the nine vegetation categories was undertaken, a vegetation map was prepared, and the area of each category was estimated. Two trapping grids were established in vegetation categories favoured by the voles. The data from these grids were used in conjunction with the vegetation map to estimate the population of voles over the whole island. Insufficient data were available for such an estimate to be made of the size of the population of mice.},

Time to disappearance of the pellet groups (days) of both species significantly differed between habitats and months; it was shorter in late summer to early autumn and in habitats with more ground vegetation. Muntjac pellet groups disappeared more quickly than roe deer pellet groups. Time to disappearance of roe deer pellet groups was negatively correlated with air and grass temperature in pre-thicket and pre-fell habitats, while time to disappearance of muntjac pellet groups was negatively correlated with frequency of rainfall and positively correlated with the run of wind (air passage over a site within a 24-h period measured in km) in pre-thicket habitats. It is the time of the standing-crop pellet-group counts and the disappearance rate of pellet groups deposited in different months and habitats that determine the appropriate method for conversion of pellet-group density to deer density.},

However, estimating densities in forested areas is problematic, with pellet-group-based methods subject to error and uncertainty in estimating defecation and decay rates in addition to sampling variance. Use of thermal imaging equipment allows direct census by distance sampling. 2. Densities of introduced Chinese muntjac Muntiacus reevesi and native roe deer Capreolus capreolus were estimated in 12.8 km(2) of conifer forest in eastern England by thermal imaging distance transects. Estimated density of introduced muntjac (+/- 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 20 +/- 8 km(-2)) exceeded that of native roe deer (16 +/- 6 km(-2)); 95% CI of c. 40% were achieved in 10 days of fieldwork. 3. Destimates were not sensitive to the number of width bands applied during analysis. Detectability functions differed, with narrower effective strip widths (ESW) for muntjac (74 m) than roe deer (123 m). Thus, it is important to discriminate between species when censusing mixed assemblages. Detectability and ESW also differed among plantation growth stages. Stratification by habitat may therefore improve accuracy of density estimates but would require additional survey effort.},

abstract = {The myxoma virus (a microparasite) reduced wild rabbit numbers worldwide when introduced in the 1950s, and is known to interact with co-infecting helminths (macroparasites) causing both increases and decreases in macroparasite population size. In the 1990s Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) infected rabbits and also significantly reduced rabbit numbers in several countries. However, not much is known about RHDV interactions with macroparasites. In this study, we compare prevalence and intensity of infection for three gastrointestinal nematode species (Trichostrongylus retortaeformis, Graphidium strigosum and Passalurus ambiguus) before and after RHDV spread across host populations in Scotland and New Zealand. During one common season, autumn, prevalence of T. retortaeformis was higher after RHDV spread in both locations, whereas it was lower for G. strigosum and P. ambiguus after RHDV arrived in New Zealand, but higher in Scotland. Meanwhile, intensity of infection for all species decreased after RHDV arrived in New Zealand, but increased in Scotland. The impact of RHDV on worm infections was generally similar across seasons in Scotland, and also similarities in seasonality between locations suggested effects on infection patterns in one season are likely similar year-round. The variable response by macroparasites to the arrival of a microparasite into Scottish and New Zealand rabbits may be due to differences in the environment they inhabit, in existing parasite community structure, and to some extent, in the relative magnitude of indirect effects. Specifically, our data suggest that bottom-up processes after the introduction of a more virulent strain of RHDV to New Zealand may affect macroparasite co-infections by reducing the availability of their shared common resource, the rabbits. Clearly, interactions between co-infecting micro- and macroparasites vary in host populations with different ecologies, and significantly impact parasite community structure in wildlife.},

abstract = {Many populations of bat species across the globe are declining, with chemical contamination one of many potential stressors implicated in these demographic changes. Metals still contaminate a wide range of habitats, but the risks to bats remain poorly understood. This study is the first to present a national scale assessment of toxic metal (Cd, Pb) and essential trace metal (Cu, Zn) concentrations in bats. Metal concentrations in tissues (kidneys, liver, stomach -stomach content, bones and fur) were measured in 193 Pipistrellus sp. in England and Wales using ICP-MS, and compared to critical toxic concentrations for small mammals. The concentrations of metals determined in bat tissues were generally lower than those reported elsewhere. Strong positive associations were found between concentrations in tissues for a given metal (liver and kidneys for Cd, Cu and Pb; stomach and fur and fur and bones for Pb), suggesting recent as well as long term exposure to these contaminants. In addition, positive correlations between concentrations of different metals in the same tissues (Cd and Zn, Cu and Zn, Cd and Pb, Pb and Zn) suggest a co-exposure of metals to bats. Approximately 21% of the bats sampled contained residues of at least one metal at concentrations high enough to elicit toxic effects (associated with kidney damage), or to be above the upper level measured in other mammal species. Pb was found to pose the greatest risk (with 7-11% of the bats containing concentrations of toxicological concern), followed by Cu (4-9%), Zn (0.5-5.2%) and Cd (0%). Our data suggest that leaching of metals into our storage matrix, formaldehyde, may have occurred, especially for Cu. The overall findings suggest that metal contamination is an environmental stressor affecting bat populations, and that further research is needed into the direct links between metal contamination and bat population declines worldwide.

The utility of small samples of fur as an indicator of metal exposure from the environment was demonstrated with strong relationships obtained between the concentrations of non-essential metals in fur with concentrations in stomach content, kidneys, liver and bones. Stronger relationships were observed for non-essential metals than for essential metals. Fur analyses might therefore be a useful non-invasive proxy for understanding recent, as well as long term and chronic, metal exposure of live animals. The use of fur may provide valuable information on the level of endogenous metal exposure and contamination of bat populations and communities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Mountain hares (Lepus timidus) are regularly harvested on Scottish moorland managed for recreational hunting of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scotica). There are concerns that large-scale culls of mountain hares on grouse moors are contributing to population declines of mountain hares in Scotland. We use hare data collected during red grouse counts in Scotland, to consider spatial and temporal variation in annual mountain hare indices of spring abundance in relation to different grouse management intensities, classified as either 'Driven' (driven grouse shooting), 'Walked-up' (walked-up shooting) or 'Not-shot' (where there was no grouse shooting interest). Trends in mountain hare abundance indices varied with region and grouse management intensity. Hare indices were higher and relatively stable on moors where driven grouse shooting was practised relative to lower indices and declines on moors where grouse were either walked-up or not shot. Abundance indices fluctuated over time in a quasi-cyclical manner, fluctuations being more pronounced where hares were more abundant, i.e. on driven grouse moors. Density-dependent processes such as resource competition and parasitism could explain greater fluctuations in areas where hare abundance indices were higher, whilst reductions in indices over time probably reflect sampling at decline phases of the cycle, particularly on driven moors, rather than being part of true long-term declines. Given our understanding of grouse moor management and mountain hare ecology, enhanced habitat management and control of generalist predators seem to be the most parsimonious explanation for higher abundances indices of mountain hare on driven grouse moors.},

abstract = {1. Fragmentation of heather and conversion to grass under heavy grazing is a widespread phenomenon. In the British uplands it is attributed in particular to the effects of sheep and red deer, but little is known about the processes by which fragmentation occurs under grazing by these different herbivores. This has hindered the prediction of herbivore impacts and thus the design of appropriate management schemes for the protection of heather-dominated vegetation. In this payer we report the results of an experiment examining the patterns of impact by sheep and red deer grazing separately or together within an area of fragmenting heather in north-east Scotland during 1991-95. 2. Heather utilization by both species declined rapidly with distance from grass, with both herbivores grazing similar amounts of heather, except in autumn where heather utilization by deer was greater than that by sheep. 3. Differential patterns of grass patch use by sheep and red deer resulted in greater heather utilization around larger grass patches by red deer, but no consistent differences in edge-heather utilization by sheep. Both species grazed less edge-heather downhill of grass patches than uphill or across the slope. Thus, we hypothesize that on sloping ground grazing impacts will be greatest uphill from grass for both herbivores, but their patterns of impact around different grass patches will diverge when a range of grass patch sizes is present. 4. Patterns of impact as a result of trampling damage differed from those due to grazing, with damage concentrated at downhill edges of patches and paths, with corresponding increases in cover of species such as Vaccinium myrtillus where the heather had declined. 5, We suggest that on sloping ground at lower herbivore densities, trampling may have more important impacts on the heather than grazing, but as herbivore densities increase the relative importance of grazing will increase, thus changing the patterns of impact on the vegetation. 6. The implications of these differences in herbivore impacts are discussed in relation to the management of heather-dominated vegetation under grazing by sheep or red deer and the limitations of approaches based on stocking rates alone.},

Analyses were based on carcass material and fecundity was assessed from the presence/absence and number of fertilised ovulations (corpora lutea) and implanted foetuses. A significant proportion (> 10%) of does ovulated in their first year in some populations, but such precocious reproductive activity rarely resulted in successful implantation of a foetus. Generally, the majority of yearling does (in their second year) conceived successfully, but average potential litter size was lower than among older animals. There was no consistent age-related variation in fecundity among does older than 2 years. Differences in fecundity between age and body weight classes suggest weight thresholds may exist for the onset of puberty and for successful conception as an adult. Fecundity of adults and yearlings was highly variable between populations and in some populations was considerably lower than previously reported for this species. Although differences between populations were correlated with differences in body weight, this relationship was insufficient to explain the wide variation in fecundity across Britain, suggesting fecundity body weight thresholds will be defined independently in separate populations.},

abstract = {(1) On heather moorland in Shetland, mountain hares (Lepus timidus L.) were more numerous than in other Scottish islands, the west and north-west of Scotland and the north of England. (2) In winter, hares were widely spaced on heather-dominated vegetation. In spring, they commonly occurred in dyads < 10 m apart. (3) Available shelter from weather and predators was less good in Shetland than in north-eastern Scotland, where mountain hares are most abundant. (4) Exposure limits the growth of heather in Shetland, and extensive burning, leading to the replacement of heather by Molinia and Trichophorum heaths, as practised in west and north-west Scotland, does not occur. (5) The large extent of heather (the main food of mountain hares) in Shetland compared with many parts of mainland Scotland probably accounts for the relative abundance of hares, and is likely to be more important than the absence of predators upon adult hares.

abstract = {(1) Grazing preferences of mountain hares in relation to the area available of each of seven main classes of moorland vegetation in north-east Scotland were studied by means of dung plots in 1984-85. (2) On heather moorland adjacent to reseeded hill pastures, mountain hares preferred the youngest class of heather (pioneer) followed by successive age-classes of early-building and late-building. If pioneer heather contained > 20% of grass, it was less preferred than early-building heather. Wild grass was preferred to all types of heather except pioneer, but reseeded hill pastures ranked fifth in use among the seven categories of vegetation. (3) Preferences between the main classes of vegetation were consistent over 2 years. (4) Within the main classes of vegetation (five of heather, two of grass), there were consistent differences between sites. These were associated with the proportion of grass among pioneer heather, preferred sites having > 20% heather cover and less grass than the other sites. Preferred sites on early-building heather resembled pioneer heather more closely than did less preferred sites. Selection against height of building heather was the likeliest cause of preferences, and probably a contributory cause in old heather. (5) Old heather, covering 37% of the study area, was used more if it contained open spaces big enough to contain a grazing hare. (6) On hill pastures, grazing by mountain hares declined sharply when sheep were introduced; numbers of sheep and hares were negatively correlated. (7) Hill sheep preferred the same types of moorland vegetation as mountain hares. There was no obvious competition between hares and rabbits, and grazing by red deer was negligible.},

abstract = {Mountain hares in north-east Scotland spent the day in forms in long heather and moved downhill in the evening to feed in hill pastures. Here they grazed intensively,often in groups of4-6 individuals. In June and July adult females, then pregnant or lactating, grazed in daylight on the pastures. Leverets spent less time grazing, and more in play and exploration. They spent the day in cover near the feeding areas, and if disturbed during grazing crouched or went into cover, while adults fled. During 1982and 1983males predominated in groups of grazing hares, but in 1984 both sexes were equally represented. These changes in sex ratio were reflected in the increased proportion of females trapped for marking between February and late July during 1982-86. There was a dominance order related to weight among male hares and dominant hares approached more females. There was no firm evidence of mate-guarding. Males approached females regardless of their oestrous state and were usually rebuffed with varying degrees of intensity including striking and chasing. There were no interactions between females. Adults of both sexes chased leverets for short distances but leveretsjoined groups of feeding adults. Neither leverets nor first-winter hares showed evidence of dispersal. Mountain hares avoided sheep and cattle and there were fewer hares after the arrival of sheep in May.},

abstract = {Fox culling practices in three contrasting rural regions (1280-2320 km(2)) of Britain were investigated by questionnaire surveys of landowners and tenant farmers. Between 50 and 52% of all farmers identified in each region contributed to the survey (total number of replies = 1123). Fox culling was widespread in all regions, with 70-95% of farmers involved either directly or indirectly as hosts. Motivation for culling foxes and the methods employed reflected regional variation in agricultural and game-shooting interests. Social factors associated with fox-hunting for sport also played an important role in one region. The contribution to the total fox cull made by communally organized groups operating over large tracts of farmland, and the efforts of individual farmers at a local scale, also varied regionally. The numbers of foxes culled were close to published estimates of annual productivity in British fox populations. Deliberate culling was therefore likely to be the chief cause of fox mortality in these regions. The marked differences in culling practices between these regions provide a strong case that the impact of culling on fox population dynamics must be assessed for regions of this size, as well as at a more local scale. Studies at a national scale (e.g. the whole of Britain) are probably of little biological or sociological significance. The success of different interest groups in achieving their aims, and the consequences of any change in culling practices must also be considered at a similar geographical scale.},

abstract = {The impact of deliberate culling of fox populations has been much debated. Although a local (< 10 km(2)) impact has been accepted, previous authors have denied that culling has any impact on a larger scale because local losses are compensated through immigration. Rather, it has been claimed that at this scale fox density is determined by resources, mediated through social behaviour and breeding suppression. We determined the impact of culling on a regional scale (>1000 km(2)), using data on culling (Heydon & Reynolds, 2000), fox density (Heydon, Reynolds & Short, 2000) and productivity. The three U.K. study regions (size 1238-2322 km(2)) were in mid-Wales (A), the east Midlands (B) and East Anglia (C). High productivity in regions A and C was associated with low density, high culling mortality and high overall mortality (all relative to region B), indicating that density was suppressed by culling. In region B (moderate) breeding suppression was associated with a higher density and lower cull than in regions A and C, implying that fox density was closer to the maximum sustainable by resources. We conclude that the impact of culling in different regions of Britain is variable, dependent on the regional prevalence, methods, and history of culling. However, it is clear that in a range of circumstances culling can substantially depress fox numbers, and that current fox densities reflect a history of culling. This conclusion is fundamental in considering the management of fox predation in farming and conservation contexts.},

abstract = {1. The objective of the study was to establish the role of endogenous circannual physiological cycles in regulating the grazing behaviour of red deer. 2. This was investigated by manipulating the timing of seasonal cycles in red deer hinds by administration of melatonin between July and October and comparing the subsequent grazing responses to either a low or high herbage biomass at the times of previously observed seasonal decline (autumn) and rise (spring) in voluntary food intake of enhoused animals. Food intake was determined using the n-alkane marker technique. 3. Melatonin treatment resulted in respective 15- and 10-day advances in the timing of the onset and termination of the breeding season of non-pregnant hinds, indicating a phase-shift in the underlying circannual rhythm of reproduction. 4. Melatonin also caused a significant depression in herbage intake by hinds grazing high herbage biomasses during autumn consistent with an advance in the timing of the seasonal appetite decline. Treatment did not affect the intake of hinds on the low biomasses in the autumn or animals on either pasture during spring. 5. The study demonstrates that endogenous seasonal appetite changes influence level of food intake in grazing deer, but the expression of these seasonal cycles is dependent upon food availability.},

abstract = {Agri-environment schemes have been introduced in countries throughout the world in an attempt to reverse the negative impacts of agricultural intensification on biodiversity and the environment. There have been some investigations into the effectiveness of such schemes, which show mixed outcomes but little is known with regard to mammals. The hedgehog is a generalist predator and preys on, among others, an array of macro-invertebrates, prey important for many other taxa. For a non-volant species, it is highly mobile in the environment and should thus be less susceptible to negative effects of habitat fragmentation caused by agricultural intensification. However, it has recently been included in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, as a result of evidence of a significant decline. We studied the importance of agri-environment schemes for hedgehogs using radio-tracking on arable farms. Both agri-environment field margins and hedgerows appear to be very valuable for hedgehogs. Both habitat types were intensively utilized by hedgehogs; higher food availability/accessibility on agri-environment field margins and higher food or nest site availability along edges and/or lower predation risk by badgers in arable areas may explain these preferences. Badger predation of hedgehogs was high in the study site and the main cause of death. Our study emphasizes the importance of natural habitat in an agricultural landscape and shows that agri-environment schemes can be beneficial to this generalist macro-invertebrate feeder. The implementation of agri-environment schemes that include wide field margins and dense, well-established hedgerows on farmland could significantly contribute to the viability of hedgehog populations in intensive arable-farming landscapes, and by implication benefit other macro-invertebrate feeders.},

abstract = {The West European hedgehog, (Erinaceus europaeus, Linnaeus 1758) is widely distributed in Western Europe. However, there is evidence of decline in parts of its range. Changes in agricultural management have partly been the driving force behind the loss of species diversity and abundance, and it has been argued that these changes play a role in the decline of hedgehogs as well. We used a questionnaire to investigate the current distribution of hedgehogs on farmland throughout Great Britain with a focus on different environmental zones. Additionally, we identified environmental correlates that related to the distribution of hedgehogs with the aim to get a better understanding of what is needed to design appropriate strategies targeted at the conservation of hedgehogs. Our study illustrates that, although the impact of several variables was rather ambiguous, displaying positive effects in some environmental zones and negative effects in other, major roads and Eurasian badgers (Meles meles, Linnaeus 1758) can have large scale negative effects on hedgehogs. Farm management related factors did not show a consistent impact on hedgehog presence. Conservation strategies should therefore be aimed at lessening the impacts of major roads and badger presence. Wildlife passages, for instance, may provide hedgehogs safe passages across roads. Additionally, increasing the habitat complexity in order to reduce the impact of predators can be beneficial for prey species, such as hedgehogs, and should be considered as a conservation strategy for them.},

abstract = {It is increasingly important to be aware of trends in species abundances in order to be able to act ahead of possible irrecoverable declines and extinctions. Long-term monitoring of species is generally used to determine how a species is faring, which is essential knowledge for conservation planning and design. However, monitoring programmes that encompass large areas and long timespans are rare or non-existent for the vast majority of species. Citizen-science-based datasets provide a wealth of data on past and present species' occurrences but are often biased to a large extent. We evaluate the potential use of such datasets by subsampling datasets collected over different time periods to detect trends in the long-term temporal abundance of West European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), a species which is thought to be in decline in parts of its geographic range. We used subsampling as a means to account for quantitative differences between two non-systematic datasets of West European hedgehog occurrences in England; one dataset was collected by the public between 1960 and 1975 and one was collected between 2000 and 2015. Here, we confirm and quantify previous anecdotal evidence of a long-term decline of the species throughout England. We find that although the West European hedgehog is still widespread in England, a 5.0 to 7.4 % decline in occupied grid cells was observed when comparing the 2000-2015 dataset to the previous survey in 1960-1975 after adjusting for differences in effort. This suggests that the decline of the relative abundance of West European hedgehogs is moderate in England, 25 % being an amber alert for birds of conservation concern in the UK. Importantly, we show that subsampling disparate citizen-science datasets is a useful tool for monitoring species population trends.},

abstract = {Understanding space use by animals plays a key role in a wide array of behavioural and ecological fields of study. An insight into how and why species use the space available to them may aid their conservation. The West European hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus, a species in decline in part of its range, is relatively mobile and adapted to a wide range of habitat types. However, it is frequently associated with edge habitats. This edge-refuging behaviour is not well understood and may be the result of fear of predators, food availability or other factors. We used radiotelemetry to investigate the movement of hedgehogs in comparable landscapes with high and low predator (badgers, Meles meles) abundance. Simultaneously, food availability was assessed in both landscapes. Our results suggest that agricultural habitats may be 'landscapes of fear' for hedgehogs in the presence of a high number of predators. On agricultural fields, hedgehogs were on average situated closer to edge cover in areas with predators present. It is thus likely to be beneficial for the conservation of hedgehogs in areas with a high number of predators to increase the complexity of the habitat structure by, among other measures, establishing more and denser hedgerows in rural areas. Our results suggest that enhancing the complexity of the habitat structure might lessen the effects of fear. Additionally, our results emphasize the importance of integrating data on predator abundance and food availability in studies that focus on habitat selection behaviour and species conservation.

An exploratory model investigated the dynamics of the sub-population process in a homogeneous (raster) landscape and explored how density dependence and movement interacted with spatial scale to affect model output. The second model applied the same sub-population dynamic across a spatially irregular, heterogeneous landscape based on UK habitat data. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) was chosen as a model species and the spread and abundance predicted by the applied model were compared with the limited field data suitable for this species in the UK. During the analysis we found a series of thresholds for sub-population size, which dictated the range of scales at which the model should be applied. If the thresholds were ignored and sub-populations were modelled at too small a scale, risk of extinction and spatial spread became exaggerated; at too large a scale, problems of spatial representation and low movement were observed. Driven by uncertain vital rates, the population model showed a range of behaviours at different scales, which were primarily explained by density dependent movement. When we applied our model to wild boar in the UK to simulate two historial releases, we achieved encouraging similarity to field observations. We are confident that we could have predicted the successful establishment of wild boar in the UK, and our approach, when refined, could be used to model future growth and spread. We found that spatial population models intended for use in heterogeneous landscapes need to be explored in the absence of confounding factors such as varying carrying capacity, in order to be certain that artefacts due to model structure are not present. We recommend the sensitivity of spatial population models to the interaction of spatial representation, movement and population process should be demonstrated at a variety of scales. We believe that the key to a successful real-world model is coherence between the numerical scale dictated by the sub-population process, the spatial scale of its representation and model stability.

abstract = {Predictive population models designed to assist managers and policy makers require an explicit treatment of inherent uncertainty and variability. These are particular concerns when modelling non-native and reintroduced species, when data have been collected within one geographical or ecological context but predictions are required for another, or when extending models to predict the consequences of environmental change (e.g., climate or land-use). We present an aspatial, probabilistic framework of hierarchical process models for predicting population growth even when data are sparse or of poor quality. Insight into the factors affecting population dynamics in real landscapes can be provided and Kullback-Leibier distances are used to compare the relative output of models. This flexible yet robust framework gives easily interpretable results, allowing managers as well as modellers to invalidate anomalous models and apply others to real-life scenarios. We illustrate the framework's power with a meta-analysis of European wild boar (Sus scrofa) data. We test hypotheses about the effect of geographic region, hunting and mast years on wild boar population growth, to build models of wild boar dynamics for the UK. The framework quantifies the importance of hunting pressure as a driver of population growth, and confirms that reproductive success is greatly decreased in poor mast years, suggesting that the key to predicting wild boar dynamics is to ascertain local hunting pressure and to better understand changing food availability. Geography had no significant effect, indicating that it is not a good proxy for modelling the impact of change in climate or land-use on wild boar populations at the European scale. We use the framework to predict population abundance 9 years after an isolated population of wild boar established in the UK; in a comparison with the only field data and two independent modelling exercises, our framework provides the most robust and informative results.

Hares stood before foxes in all heights of vegetation and on 42 % of occasions were solitary. Hares did not stand before approaching dogs (Canis familiaris).

abstract = {1. Bovine tuberculosis (TB) occurs in cattle and badgers in the UK and control efforts are undertaken to reduce the spread of the disease. 2. This study evaluates relationships predicted by nine epidemiological two-host models of disease spread generated by various combinations of density-dependent, frequency-dependent and environmental pathogen transmission. The relationships of interest are between measures of TB in cattle and in badgers from 10 sites which were randomly selected to be proactive badger culling sites in the UK Randomized Badger Culling Trial. The data are from the initial badger cull only. 3. There was most support (Akaike weight = 0.562, R-2 = 0.869) for models that predicted a positive linear relationship between density of infectious cattle per square kilometre and the density index of infectious badgers. There was less support (Akaike weight = 0.060) for a model that predicted a positive linear relationship between density of infectious cattle per square kilometre and the proportion of badgers infectious with Mycobacterium bovis. A correction to reduce effects of badger carcase storage and an examination of effects of the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic had little impact on estimated relationships. 4. Synthesis and applications. The results provide support for two-host disease models of TB in cattle and wildlife such as badgers, although the form of disease transmission cannot be identified clearly by these analyses. The implication of the results is that the best-fitting models predict that, in the absence of intervention-related changes in badger behaviour, a reduction in density of infectious badgers should reduce the density of infectious cattle. However, analysis of bait-marking data collected following experimental badger culls indicated that culling badgers profoundly alters their spatial organization as well as their population density, potentially influencing contact rates. Effective vaccination of badgers, were it to become available, would be expected to reduce the density of infectious badgers without directly affecting their behaviour.},

journal = {Frontiers in Zoology},
volume = {11},
pages = {15},
abstract = {Background: Temperate winters produce extreme energetic challenges for small insectivorous mammals. Some bat species inhabiting locations with mild temperate winters forage during brief inter-torpor normothermic periods of activity. However, the winter diet of bats in mild temperate locations is studied infrequently. Although microscopic analyses of faeces have traditionally been used to characterise bat diet, recently the coupling of PCR with second generation sequencing has offered the potential to further advance our understanding of animal dietary composition and foraging behaviour by allowing identification of a much greater proportion of prey items often with increased taxonomic resolution. We used morphological analysis and Illumina-based second generation sequencing to study the winter diet of Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri) and compared the results obtained from these two approaches. For the first time, we demonstrate the applicability of the Illumina MiSeq platform as a data generation source for bat dietary analyses. Results: Faecal pellets collected from a hibernation site in southern England during two winters (December-March 2009-10 and 2010-11), indicated that M. nattereri forages throughout winter at least in a location with a mild winter climate. Through morphological analysis, arthropod fragments from seven taxonomic orders were identified. A high proportion of these was non-volant (67.9% of faecal pellets) and unexpectedly included many lepidopteran larvae. Molecular analysis identified 43 prey species from six taxonomic orders and confirmed the frequent presence of lepidopteran species that overwinter as larvae. Conclusions: The winter diet of M. nattereri is substantially different from other times of the year confirming that this species has a wide and adaptable dietary niche. Comparison of DNA derived from the prey to an extensive reference dataset of potential prey barcode sequences permitted fine scale taxonomic resolution of prey species. The high occurrence of non-volant prey suggests that gleaning allows prey capture at low ambient temperatures when the abundance of flying insects may be substantially reduced. Interesting questions arise as to how M. nattereri might successfully locate and capture some of the non-volant prey species encountered in its faeces. The consumption of lepidopteran larvae such as cutworms suggests that M. nattereri eats agricultural pest species.},

abstract = {The frequency and function of arousals during hibernation in free-living mammals are little known. We used temperature-sensitive radio transmitters to measure patterns of torpor, arousal and activity in wild Natterer's bats Myotis nattereri during hibernation. Duration of torpor bouts ranged from 0.06 to 20.4 days with individual means ranging from 0.9 to 8.9 days. Arousals from torpor occurred most commonly coincident with the time (relative to sunset) typical for bats emerging from summer roosts to forage. Bats with lower body condition indices had a shorter average duration of their torpor bouts. We found a non-linear relationship between duration of torpor bout and ambient temperature: the longest average torpor bouts were at temperatures between 2 and 4A degrees C with shorter bouts at lower and higher ambient temperatures. One individual was radio-tracked for ten nights, remained active for an average of 297 min each night and was active for longer on warmer nights. Our results suggest that vespertilionid bats use relatively short torpor bouts during hibernation in a location with a maritime climate. We hypothesise that Natterer's bats time arousals to maximise opportunities for potential foraging during winter although winter feeding is not the sole determinant of arousal as bats still arouse at times when foraging is unlikely.},

Some hibernating mammals maintain biological rhythms even during deep torpor; however, cues used for entrainment are poorly understood. We studied activity in an assemblage of hibernating Myotis bats (mainly M. nattereri) inhabiting a temperate maritime climate over 3 consecutive winters using ultrasound detectors and a series of active infrared motion detectors. Here we demonstrate that the timing of peak activity changed as day length changed over winter, but nevertheless remained entrained to a time close to dusk that would be most advantageous for winter foraging. Diurnal activity was infrequent throughout winter. There was an increase in activity at higher hibernaculum temperatures, particularly as temperatures rose above the lower threshold for insect flight (6-10 degrees C). Finally we show that ultrasound detectors and infrared motion detectors produce broadly comparable measures of bat activity within a hibernation site.},

This study reports the first evidence that the presence of conspecifics continues to influence the caching behaviour of a scatter-hoarding mammal, the grey squirrel, after a suitable cache site has been selected and the hoarder is filling and covering its cache. Wild grey squirrels were filmed when storing preferred and less preferred nuts and when they were alone or with conspecifics present. In line with previous findings, squirrels spent longer travelling from the nut patch and were more vigilant when conspecifics were present. However, squirrels also spent longer disguising their caches and were more likely to stop digging and become vigilant when conspecifics were present than when they were alone. In particular, they were most likely to curtail their digging when storing their preferred nuts in the presence of conspecifics. The results indicate that caching squirrels remain sensitive to the presence of conspecifics until the cache is complete and that they respond flexibly to conspecifics according to the type of food they are storing.},

abstract = {Scatter-hoarding animals transport food away from its source before storing it to maximize the likelihood that the cache will survive for use at a later time. However, the more time animals spend transporting and storing the food the less time they have for food collection. Previous studies suggest that the time animals spend on caching depends to some extent on the availability of food and on the presence of conspecifics at the food source. We tested whether a scatter-hoarding mammal responds flexibly to conspecifics as competitors according to the availability of food or if they respond more directly to them as potential pilferers. We used multiple linear regression to model the time eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) took to return to nut patches of varying quality after collecting a nut for caching when they were alone and when conspecifics were present. The results provide the first evidence that scatter hoarders respond to conspecifics at a food source primarily as competitors rather than as potential pilferers; the squirrels increased the rate at which they returned to the nut patch when conspecifics were present rather than transport the nuts farther away to minimize the risk of pilferage. In contrast, and in line with previous studies, the squirrels responded to a reduction in the availability of food by increasing the distance at which they stored the food from the source.},

abstract = {Distance sampling is a common and increasingly used method of estimating animal abundance in conservation and management programmes. The precision of a distance sampling survey can be estimated from the field data, but accuracy can only be evaluated by comparison with the true population size. For wild mammal populations, such opportunities are rare. The high-density badger Meles meles population at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire, U.K. has been routinely and intensively live-trapped for the past 30 years. The estimates of abundance based on mark-recapture analyses of the live-trapping data provided a reliable baseline against which to evaluate distance sampling for a badger population. A distance sampling survey was carried out in autumn 2002 by using spotlighting along line transects. Owing to the impractical nature of spotlighting in closed habitats, such as woodland, surveys were conducted in open habitat only. A radio-tracking study provided behavioural data that were used to estimate the proportion of the population available for sampling in open habitats. This was incorporated as a multiplier into the DISTANCE analysis. The estimate of abundance from distance sampling was 76 badgers (% CV = 42.2), using a multiplier based on radio-tracking data from autumn only. When the multiplier was derived from radio-tracking data from across the whole year, based on a larger sample of tracked badgers, the distance sampling abundance estimate was 77 badgers (% CV = 25.9). These compared favourably to the mark-recapture estimate of 68 badgers (% C.V = 7.4). The lack of precision in the distance sampling density estimate was largely owing to the inclusion of the multiplier. Distance sampling combined with data on habitat use can produce reliable estimates of badger abundance in areas of medium to high density, particularly in landscapes of primarily open habitat.},

A population viability analysis was performed, using the VORTEX software to establish an MVP. The sensitivity of the results to alternative modelling strategies was tested. An initial population of 300 individuals had a probability >0.95 of surviving 50 years, and was identified as the MVP. Supplementation of the population with unrelated individuals was also simulated, and a range of strategies modelled. With a supplementation level of four animals every 5 years the MVP was reduced to just 10 animals. Based on a review of Sus scrofa ecology, woodland habitats suitable for supporting wild boar were identified Only woodlands containing some stands of semi-natural origin were considered. The suitability of the three largest woodlands for supporting an MVP was further reviewed at site level. None could be considered optimum habitat for wild boar and none was large enough to support an MVP of 300 animals. The study conducted that the goal of establishing a self-sustaining population of wild boar in Scotland is unrealistic in the short term.

pages = {188-198},
abstract = {Natural England receives an increasing number of complaints about problems caused by badgers Meles meles in urban and suburban environments, most of which concern problems caused by the digging of burrows (setts). The aim of our study was to identify factors related to the presence of badger setts in urban and suburban areas, in order to provide information relevant to the development of an urban badger management strategy. We identified habitat factors (including human population density) associated with the presence of badger setts in four extensively surveyed towns or cities in England, in a GIS-based approach using binary logistic regression analysis. Badger sett densities in urban areas were comparable to sett densities in most rural parts of the UK. Thus, badgers can achieve relatively high population densities in urban environments, despite the potential for human-badger conflict. The single most important factor predicting sett location was the type of habitat in which the sett in question was located, followed by the slope of the ground at that location. Sett presence was also predicted by the proximity of other setts, and badgers preferred areas with intermediate human population densities. The population density of badgers in urban and suburban environments appears to be mainly related to the availability of suitable places for locating setts, rather than to factors that would be expected to reflect food availability. This information will help to predict potential sites of badger-related problems and may be relevant to understanding the ecological requirements of other carnivore species that inhabit urban environments, such as red fox Vulpes vulpes, stone marten Martes foina and racoon Procyon lotor.},

abstract = {Radio-telemetry is often the method of choice for Studies of species whose behaviour is difficult to observe directly. However, considerable debate has ensued about the best way of deriving home-range estimates. In recent years, kernel estimators have become the most widely used method, together with the oldest and simplest method, the minimum convex polygon (MCP). More recently, it has been Suggested that the local convex hull (LCH) might be more appropriate than kernel methods in cases where an animal's home range includes a priori inaccessible areas. Yet another method, the Brownian bridge (BB), explicitly uses autocorrelated data to determine movement paths and, ultimately, home ranges or migration routes of animals. Whereas several studies have used Simulation techniques to compare these different methods, few have used data from real animals. We used radio-telemetric data from urban badgers Meles meles to compare two sampling protocols (10-minute vs at least 30-minute inter-fix intervals) and four home-range estimators (MCP, fixed kernels (FK), LCH and BB). We used a multi-response permutation procedure and randomisation tests to compare overall patterns of fixes and degree of overlap of home ranges estimated using data from different sampling protocols, and a general linear model to compare the influence of sampling protocols and home-range estimator on the size of habitat patches. The shape of the estimated home ranges was influenced by sampling protocol in some cases. By contrast, the sizes and proportions of different habitats within home ranges were influenced by estimator type but not by sampling protocol. LCH performed consistently better than FK, and is especially appropriate for patchy study areas containing frequent no-go zones. However, we recommend using LCH in combination with other methods to estimate total range size, because LCH tended to produce smaller estimates than any other method. Results relating to BB are preliminary but suggest that this method is unsuitable for species in which range size is small compared to average travel speed.},

abstract = {A group of 20 pipistrelle bats were taken into captivity and allowed free flight and association within a flight room where they gave birth to and successfully reared 17 young. The flight of the females was recorded during pregnancy, early lactation and post-lactation by using stroboscopic stereophotogrammetry (153 flights reconstructed in total). During the investigation body mass was altering owing to reproductive condition, and changes in mass were recorded daily for ail (adult and juvenile) bats during the entire study period, which lasted from two weeks before the last birth until release, when the oldest baby was 43 days old. All bats were individually marked, and detailed morphological measurements were made. Pregnant and post-lactating bats were heavier than lactating bats, which showed the lowest wingbeat frequencies. The flight speeds of pregnant, lactating and post-lactating bats showed no significant differences, and this may be because the pregnant bats appeared to have a wider scope for selecting flight speed than the other two reproductive groups, or than animals studied previously. The group of bats as a whole decreased flight speed (scaling as M(-0.43)) and increased wingbeat frequency (scaling as M(-0.58)) as their mass increased. Wingbeat amplitude showed no relation to body mass, wing area or span, flight speed or frequency.

abstract = {Over the last century in the uplands of Scotland, the extent of heather moorland which supports high densities of mountain hares Lepus timidus has diminished and has gradually been replaced by large-scale commercial forestry plantations or expanding natural woodlands. The potential impact of such a change in land use on host-parasite interactions was investigated by comparing the intensity and prevalence of infection of hares by parasites in two separate habitats: a large hare-fenced young forestry plantation and the adjacent open moorland. Carcasses were collected in November 1990 from within both habitats and after the woodland had been enclosed for nine months. Age, sex, fatness (kidney fat index) and degree of infection of hares were noted. Two parasites were recorded: the nematode Trichostrongylus retortaeformis and the cestode Mosgovoyia pectinata. Clear differences in the intensity of infection of adults occupying the different habitats had occurred in the nine months since woodland enclosure. Adult mountain hares in the woodland had levels of infections approaching four times that observed in hares occupying the open moorland and although not significant, the prevalence of infection was greater in hosts inhabiting the woodland than the open moorland. It is suggested that the parasite-host relationship differs between the two habitats and as heather-dominated moorland landscapes become more fragmented with the increasing establishment of woodlands, the impact of parasites on the life history strategies of mountain hares needs to be reconsidered.},

In the UK and elsewhere in Europe, high densities of mountain hares Lepus timidus are associated with heather moorland, the area of which has been diminished by large-scale afforestation. The consequences of this landscape change for the diet composition and body weight of mountain hares were investigated by comparing mountain hare carcasses collected in November 1990 simultaneously from a large hare-fenced, young forestry plantation and from the adjacent heather moorland. The sex, age, diet composition and body weight of individual hares were recorded. There were readily identifiable differences in the diet composition and body weight of hares that occupied the two different habitats, the segregation of which had been rigorously maintained for the previous nine months and included the period of births of leverets. Adult females and leverets in the young forestry plantation had a higher proportion of grasses and a lower proportion of heather in their stomachs than the same age/sex classes on the open moorland, and leverets occupying the forestry plantation were significantly heavier than those inhabiting the moorland habitat. Large-scale afforestation results in an improvement in diet quality and body weights in young mountain hares during the early plantation stages, and in those early years following planting, commercial afforestation is probably not detrimental to mountain hare populations. Persistence of mountain hare populations in afforested landscapes could be facilitated by the incorporation of appropriate young age classes of forest.},

abstract = {1. The range size of adult female mountain hares (Lepus timidus L.) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.), occupying a landscape composed of moorland, young forest and upland pasture, were studied by radio-telemetry. The factors that affect range size of the two species were identified and interpreted with regard to their respective feeding strategies; mountain hares are summer grazers that browse in winter whereas rabbits eat grasses throughout the year. 2. Individual mountain hares were classified as 'moorland', 'forest' or 'pasture' hares, and individual rabbits were classified as 'forest', 'pasture' or 'mixture' rabbits according to the frequency with which they used each habitat. Home-range size of both species was highly variable with a mean area (and standard deviation) of 22 . 2 ha (SD = 18 . 5) for hares and 6 . 3 ha (SD = 3 . 9) for rabbits. 3. Home-range size of mountain hares varied according to habitat and season. There was a negative correlation between home-range size and the available green biomass of grass, This suggests that the large home ranges of 'moorland' hares during the breeding and post-breeding seasons may have been a consequence of low food availability. 4. Home-range size of rabbits also varied according to habitat and season, but was not clearly associated with food availability, feeding strategy or social behaviour. 5. In the early years following planting, extensive afforestation of upland moorlands is unlikely to affect mountain hare and rabbit populations if an abundant ground flora is available. Individuals of both species may even remain entirely within the plantation using very small home-ranges. However, single age plantations would have to be restructured to increase the age diversity and hence the availability of suitable habitats for long-term maintenance of viable populations of mountain hares.},

abstract = {Herbivores with an intermediate feeding strategy either vary their diet between a grazing (bulk roughage feeders) or browsing (concentrate selectors) strategy on a seasonal basis or select a mixed diet at any one time. The underlying ecological causes of the seasonal dietary shift in a small non-ruminant intermediate feeder - the mountain or arctic hare (Lepus timidus L.) were determined. Diet composition and selection relative to availability were investigated for 41 individual free-ranging mountain hares (of which 18 female hares were radio-collared) occupying an upland mosaic landscape in north-east Scotland. Diet composition was determined using faecal n-alkane analysis. Radio-collared hares were designated as pasture, woodland or moorland hares according to the habitat that predominated their home-range. In common with previous studies, mountain hares switched from a browse-dominated diet during winter to a Gramineae-dominated diet in summer, although it was only significant for reproductively active females during the peak breeding season. Diet composition remained consistent regardless of habitat occupied. However, the diet of radio-tracked hares differed significantly from the biomass available in the individual home-ranges; Gramineae were preferentially selected over browse species throughout the year. During winter and in particular during the early breeding season, intermediate feeders, such as mountain hares, ate browse material when the availability of higher quality was restricted. The ability to browse or graze represents a flexible foraging strategy permitting survival and production through periods of changing or unpredictable forage quality and availability.},

abstract = {1. Mountain hares (Lepus timidus L.) are summer grazers that switch to browse in winter, while rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) eat mostly grasses throughout the year. These different feeding strategies may underlie seasonal patterns of habitat selection by the two species. 2. In this study the habitat utilization by adult female mountain hares and adult female rabbits was studied by radio-tracking in a habitat composed of open moorland, upland pasture and young forestry plantation with an abundant ground flora. The selection of feeding habitats by populations of both species was assessed by faecal counts within the same landscape. 3. Despite the common perception that mountain hares in Britain are associated with moorland, open moorland was avoided by the radio-tracked adult female mountain hares relative to its availability. Throughout the year, the radio-tracked hares preferred the forest and pasture habitats relative to availability. Only seven of the 20 hares radio-tracked were ever located on the moorland, which would suggest that the presence of moorland is not a prerequisite for the presence of mountain hares. 4. Radio-tracked adult female rabbits utilized the habitats in proportion to their availability. 5. Counts of faecal pellets indicated that utilization of forestry plantations by both species declined as a spruce forest matures although hare populations persist in mature pine plantations with an abundant ground flora. 6. Mountain hares appear to be more adaptable than rabbits in their use of the habitats in this study, a behavioural tactic underpinned by their flexible feeding strategy. Rabbit populations would persist in areas following afforestation, especially where upland pastures are in close proximity to woodland and mountain hares would be capable of exploiting many of the new habitats that are created, at least in the early years of forest development.},

pages = {663-667},
abstract = {Brodie, Formanowicz & Brodie (1991) defined anti-predation mechanisms as those character- istics of prey that reduce the probability of successful predation. There are numerous examples of animals altering their general activity levels in the presence of predators; see the reviews by Lima & Dill (1990) and Hileman & Brodie (1994). For many species, hunting pressures by humans far exceed those of natural forms of predation, e.g. both wolves (Canis lupus) and brown bears (Ursus arctos) were hunted to extinction in Britain (Clutton-Brock, 1991). Brown hares (Lepus europaeus) have been hunted by humans for millenia, and were introduced into Britain by the Romans because of their value as a quarry species. Today, three main hunting techniques are used in Britain, namely shooting, coursing, and beagling, and these may reduce hare numbers by up to 69% (Stoate & Tapper, 1993). Hunting by humans therefore has the potential to exert a strong selective pressure, and so any behavioural trait which aids the survival of hunted hares might be expected to be strongly favoured. Here we present evidence to suggest that the hunting techniques currently used in Britain have caused brown hares to develop behaviour patterns most likely to promote their survival when faced with a particular type of hunting pressure.},

Eighteen badger latrines (greater than one dung pit containing faeces), 74 single defecations not in pits and 21 faeces in single pits were located in spring when badgers were defending well-defined territories. Woodland was selected, and arable land avoided, for latrine sites. Pasture and built-up land was selected for single defecations not in pits whereas faeces in single pits were distributed randomly across habitat types. Faecal scent marks were strongly associated with the edge of pastoral fields rather than the middle. Forty-six and 51 urinations were located in spring and summer, respectively. Urine was deposited randomly across habitat types but was concentrated at the linear features surrounding the main setts. This is the first reported use of high levels of single defecations and urinations in badger scent marking strategies in the UK.

The majority of studies describing faecal and urine scent marking behaviour of badgers have been undertaken in areas of high population density and have concentrated on the use of Latrines, where Large quantities of faeces and urine accumulate in highly localized areas. However, recent studies suggest that at tow population densities, badgers distribute their faecal and urine scent marks in a more dispersed pattern. Here we compare the scent marking behaviour of badgers across a range of population densities in Britain. Badgers placed greater proportions of faeces and urine at latrines with increasing population density, a change consistent with a shift from hinterland to boundary marking. We propose that previous descriptions of badger scent marking behaviour in Britain represent points along a continuum. The implications of the correlations between badger population density and scent marking are discussed in relation to the potential for transmission of bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) from badger excreta to cattle.},

Mustelids have a number of different scent mark types that can be used for several possible functions, creating a flexible system of varied scent-marking strategies both across and within species. We review the types of scent marks used by European mustelids in relation to their social systems and consider the various hypotheses proposed for their function. Scent-marking behaviour is nor fixed for each species, but varies with habitat and population density. We use Badgers (Meles meles) as an example of mustelids acting as reservoirs of disease and Otters (Lutra lutra) as an example of a key conservation species, to demonstrate the applied importance of understanding natural patterns of mustelid scent-marking strategies and the impact of habitat and population management on them.},

The general prediction that habitat selection varied with biomass, and reflected the potential rate of intake defined by the functional response, was also tested. The main alternative predictions, that both intake rate and habitat selection increased asymptotically with biomass, or were biased towards intermediate habitat standing crop biomasses, were distinguished. 4. There was no relationship between biomass and short-term rate of intake on the narrow-leaved Festuca swards, but on the broad-leaved Lolium sward the short-term rate of intake increased asymptotically with biomass. 5. In a field experiment on Lolium swards, a population of free-living wild rabbits selected the shortest swards with the lowest biomasses, and which provided the lowest potential rates of intake. 6. Results demonstrate that free-living wild rabbits do not select habitats that provide the maximum potential rate of intake, nor did they select foraging habitat with intermediate standing crops. It is suggested that their selection of foraging areas in these grasslands which typify rabbit foraging habitat, is dominated by antipredator considerations rather than purely by rate of intake.},

Stomach contents of mountain hares (Lepus timidus L.) were collected at a standardized time of day from March to November to determine the botanical and chemical constitution of the diet. Hares ate two major food types, heather [Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull.] and grasses. The plant phenolics in the diet derived mainly from the former. The mean proportion of Calluna in the diet was lower in summer than in spring and autumn. In summer, the stomachs of reproductively active females and leverets contained smaller proportions of Calluna than non-reproducing females. This resulted in lower concentrations of plant phenolics in their stomachs but had no effect on the stomachs' nitrogen content. These categories of hare apparently avoid plants with phenolics whereas we detected no selection for or against nitrogen.},

abstract = {Many ecologically based wildlife-habitat models provide only limited explanations of the observed data because they do not take account of the way in which key factors driving distribution interact with local management. If models are to be credible tools for developing solutions for wildlife management, they need to integrate scientific knowledge with the wealth of knowledge held by those who manage these resources. In this study, we develop a participatory approach to integrate local knowledge from deer managers with formal scientific understanding and ecological spatial data in a simple Geographic Information System (GIS) to predict red deer Cervus elaphus L. distribution in the uplands of Scotland. We evaluate the extent to which the predictions are improved by this process. The initial GIS prediction matched both managers' experience of deer locations and the independently derived deer point count data in around 50% of all cases. An analysis of interviews with managers indicated that for red deer, shelter provided by habitat characteristics was more important than topographic shelter or the forage value of the habitat. Disturbance, slope and elevation were also important. Analysis of the underlying spatial characteristics of those areas preferred by deer, as defined by managers, indicated similar relative importance of these factors in driving deer distribution. The model was modified to incorporate the managers' knowledge and new predictions were evaluated against existing deer distribution data. The match between point counts and areas predicted by the model as being highly suitable for deer increased from around 50% to around 80%. Synthesis and applications. Our evaluations demonstrate the validity of using local knowledge which can substantially improve the predictions from simple spatial models of deer habitat suitability. Our approach enables knowledge from different sources and at different spatial scales to be combined to give realistic predictions of deer distribution at an appropriate scale. Such participatory approaches to wildlife-habitat model development have the potential to improve communication and consensus across ownership boundaries where different management objectives exist.},

abstract = {1. Introduced predators area major threat to island avifaunas world-wide. In the Western Isles of Scotland, recently introduced hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus have become a serious predator of bird eggs and are an important cause of declines of some waders (Charadrii). 2. Experiments at two sites in 1998 measured the effect on wader nest success resulting from hedgehog removal from fenced exclosures. The nest success of waders inside the plots (where hedgehog densities were zero or low) was approximately 2.4 times that of birds nesting in the adjacent control areas (where hedgehog densities were high). There was no evidence of a compensatory increase in egg loss to native avian predators. 3. The experiment was an integral part of a research programme to support wader conservation efforts. On the basis of the experiment it can be predicted that the removal of hedgehogs on a larger scale would result in a large increase in nest success. 4. The study also tested the practicalities of using relatively cheap fences against hedgehogs. Fences were generally effective, but on dry sandy ground rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus burrowed under fences, enabling some hedgehogs to re-enter plots, Well-designed fences could be used as a conservation tool, both as a barrier to protect key sites, and to aid the trapping and removal of hedgehogs. However, fences cannot be seen as a long-term solution to the problem. 5. Radio-tagged hedgehogs removed from the plots and released nearby all attempted to re-enter the plots. Two tracking methods revealed that displaced hedgehogs followed fences for distances up to 500 m looking for an entry point. There was no evidence that hedgehogs were able, or even attempted, to climb over or dig under fences. 6. The establishment of hedgehogs in the Western Isles provides an example of a threat to biodiversity following human-mediated redistribution of a species native to the UK to parts of the UK (Scottish islands) outside the species' natural range, an activity not currently prohibited by lawn Policy action to deter or control species introduction should consider ecological range even within national boundaries.},

These hedgehogs have caused serious declines in internationally important ground-nesting shorebirds, and population control is now being attempted. Sexual behaviour commenced in late April, a few days after the main emergence from hibernation. It peaked in mid-May and again in late June/early July, and ceased by mid-August. Females were promiscuous and were estimated to have sexual encounters (although not necessarily matings) with at least five males during the main mating period. Two-thirds of females attempted to breed for the first time in their second calendar year (i.e. as sub-adults), and the rest in their third calendar year (i.e. as adults). At least 96% (n=27) of adult females attempted to breed in the early part of the season (litters born in June). The vast majority (81%, n=26) bred again in the later part of the season (litters born after mid-July). Breeding success (>= 1 young emerged) was relatively high. For adults, 63% (n=24) of early-season and 86% (n=18) of late-season attempts were successful. For sub-adult females the figure was 62% (n=9). The annual mean productivity per female was estimated at 4.04 young for adults and 0.85 young for sub-adults. The implications of these results for the effectiveness, timing and welfare aspects of hedgehog control programmes are discussed.},

abstract = {Introduced hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus are a known threat to ground-nesting birds on many islands. Spring hedgehog density and sex ratio were measured over a 5-year period at four plots on the 315 km(2) Hebridean island of South Uist. The mean instantaneous density on the sandy-soiled machair plots (31.8 hedgehogs km(-2), SE 2.95) was over twice that on the peaty-soiled blackland plots (15.4 hedgehogs km(-2), SE 3.46), a difference reflecting the amount of preferred foraging habitat (mainly pasture). Plot population densities fluctuated approximately in unison. Year-to-year density changes were strongly correlated with temperature in the preceding winter and previous year's spring/summer, indicating that warmer conditions promote both survival and breeding success. The mean spring sex ratio of sub-adults (animals born in the previous calendar year) was not significantly different from 1M:1F. However, the 1.8M:1F ratio observed for adults was significantly male biased, probably a result of female mortality associated with rearing young. The study estimates that in an average year the South Uist hedgehog population numbers c. 2750 (95% confidence limit +/- 800) adults and sub-adults and these produce around 3000 young. Compared with the native range, hedgehog densities on South Uist are shown to be unusually high, probably because their natural predators are absent. High hedgehog densities have led directly to high rates of egg predation of ground-nesting shorebirds and subsequent declines in bird populations. The results suggest that over the past 20 years egg losses have become more severe and control of hedgehogs more difficult because climate warming has resulted in generally more favourable conditions for hedgehogs on the islands.},

abstract = {Populations of waders (Charadrii) on machair habitats on the island of South Uist were counted and wader nests were monitored to determine nest success and causes of failure. There were large declines in wader numbers and nest success following the spread of the introduced hedgehog throughout the island. Predation of wader eggs by hedgehogs was frequent, but susceptibility varied among wader species, being between 0 and 60% of the nests started. Wader species that were susceptible to hedgehog predation tended to suffer larger population declines than those that were less Susceptible, with the exception that the ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula) population declined markedly even though their nests were depredated by hedgehogs infrequently. A combined analysis of mark-resighting and radio-tracking data produced an average hedgehog population density estimate of 57 adults km(-2) was estimated that wader eggs only provided 0.7-5.5% of the energy requirements of hedgehogs, even during the season when most eggs were taken. Prom this it is argued that the abundance of hedgehogs and the intensity of their predation on wader eggs are unlikely to diminish in response to wader population declines. Unless some presently unidentified density-dependent mechanism compensates for low nest success, local extinctions of susceptible wader species are likely if no action is taken to reduce hedgehog predation. This appears to be the first documented case of hedgehogs threatening an internationally important bird population with regional extinction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To test this hypothesis, short-tailed field voles Microtus agrestis (Linnaeus) were captured during the winters of 1995/96 and 1996/97 at two field sites near Aberdeen (57 degreesN). The captured animals were tagged and taken back to the laboratory, where their resting metabolism (RMR), thermogenic capacity (NA induced metabolism excluding RMR) and body mass were measured. 3. Body mass, RMR and thermogenic capacity did not differ significantly between the start and end of winter in voles that were captured at both times. 4. Body mass varied significantly over the winter months, being lowest in January and highest in March. Thermogenic capacity also varied over the winter and the variation was Linked significantly with changes in ambient temperature, suggesting that either voles with greater thermogenic capacity were more likely to be active on cold nights, or voles were flexible in their thermogenic capacities RMR did not vary significantly over the winter. 5. Animals that survived the winter had a significantly higher residual RMR than those that died (or permanently emigrated) but the survivors did not have significantly greater body masses, RMRs, thermogenic capacities or residual thermogenic capacities.},

abstract = {Red deer Cervus elaphus, even in wilderness areas, are increasingly exposed to disturbance from human recreation as well as hunting, and it has been suggested that both types of disturbance may be perceived as a predation risk. We studied the vigilance behaviour of red deer in the Scottish Highlands, in sites with traditionally high numbers of visitors ('disturbed') and sites with relatively few visitors ('less-disturbed') during the main recreational season (spring and summer), and in their mating grounds during the hunting season (autumn and winter). We carried out direct observations, using scan sampling at 3-minute intervals for 1-hour periods, and recorded the number of animals in each group that were vigilant and their mode of vigilance. During the recreational season, in both the disturbed and less-disturbed sites, data were collected in habitats with different levels of cover (grassland, heather and woodland). The percentage of animals that were vigilant was higher in disturbed than in less-disturbed sites, and higher in disturbed grassland (poor cover) and heather (intermediate cover) than in disturbed woodland (good cover). The majority of the vigilant animals in disturbed heather and woodland habitats and in all the less-disturbed habitats were standing. In disturbed grassland, however, lying was the main posture whilst vigilant. In both disturbed grassland and heather, the percentage of vigilant animals that were moving was higher than in woodland or the less-disturbed habitats. In disturbed sites, the deer were more likely to be aggregated when vigilance levels were high. During the hunting season, the overall level of vigilance was higher than at any sites during the recreational season, and the majority of vigilant animals were moving. We conclude that red deer respond to disturbance from human recreational activities by increasing their level of vigilance, but that the nature of their response varies with the level of cover available. We suggest that red deer may lie down when keeping vigil in grasslands, because lying animals are less conspicuous and the low cover will still allow animals to scan their surroundings. We conclude that, although they respond to both types of disturbance by increasing vigilance, red deer perceive human recreation as a less acute threat than hunting.},

pages = {53-61},
abstract = {Previous studies have shown that Eastern grey squirrels modify their behaviour while foraging to offset risks of social and predatory costs, but none have simultaneously compared whether such modifications are performed at a cost to foraging. The present study directly compares how grey squirrels respond to cues of these risks while foraging. We simulated social risk and predatory risk using acoustic playbacks of stimuli that grey squirrels might be exposed to at a foraging patch: calls of conspecifics, heterospecifics (competitor and non-competitor) and predators. We found that grey squirrels responded to predator, heterospecific competitor and conspecific playbacks by altering their foraging and vigilance behaviours. Foraging was most disrupted by increased vigilance when we played calls of predators. Squirrels' response to calls of heterospecific competitors did not differ from their response to conspecific calls, and they resumed foraging more quickly after both compared to predator calls: whereas they showed little response to calls of non-competitor heterospecifics and a white noise control. We conclude that squirrels respond differentially to calls made by conspecifics, heterospecific competitors and predators, with the most pronounced response being to calls of predators. We suggest that squirrels may view conspecific and corvid vocalisations as cues of potential conflict while foraging, necessitating increased vigilance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Availability of suitable roost sites may limit bat distribution and abundance. We compared nine internal and 26 external features of 21 known roost buildings with those of 17 random buildings in northeast Scotland, U.K. (57 degrees N) to assess whether pipistrelle bats, Pipistrellus pipistrellus (55-kHz phonotype) are selective in their use of roosts. Bats did not select roosts with specific structural attributes. Compared with random buildings, roosts were closer to a tree over 10 m tall and had a greater percentage cover (of trees over 10 m tall) within a radius of 50 m. Trees may provide benefits by providing shelter and thus ameliorating the microclimate of the roost. Cover may also provide protection from predators so that bats are able to emerge earlier, thus increasing foraging time. Bats in the present study emerged 11 min earlier from roosts with 29% cover than from roosts with 3% cover, potentially gaining as much as 10% of their daily energy requirements in this extra time. Roosts were also more likely to have linear vegetation elements leading away from them. These features may be important for navigation, foraging or predator avoidance. Compared with random buildings roosts were closer to and surrounded by a greater area of deciduous woodland within a radius of 0.5 km, had a greater area of coniferous woodland within a radius of 0.5 km, and were more likely to be found within 0.5 km of a major river. All these factors are likely to be beneficial for foraging. A logistic regression model indicated that percentage cover within 50 m of the building was the best predictor of the presence or absence of bats roosting in a building.

abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, has serious consequences for Britain's cattle industry. European badgers (Meles meles) can transmit infection to cattle, and for many years the British government culled badgers in a series of attempts to reduce cattle infections. We investigated the impact of badger culling on the spatial distribution of M. bovis infection in badger and cattle populations in replicated areas in England. M. bovis infection was significantly clustered within badger populations, but clustering was reduced when culls were repeated across wide areas. A significant spatial association between M. bovis infections in badgers and cattle herds likewise declined across successive culls. These patterns are consistent with evidence that badgers are less territorial and range more widely in culled areas, allowing transmission to occur over greater distances. Prior to culling, M. bovis infections were clustered within cattle populations. Where badger culling was localised, and in unculled areas just outside widespread culling areas, cattle infections became less spatially clustered as badger culling was repeated. This is consistent with expanded badger ranging observed in these areas. In contrast, clustering of infection in cattle persisted over time on lands where badgers were repeatedly culled over wide areas. While this lack of a temporal trend must be interpreted with caution, it might reflect persistent infection within, and continued transmission between, cattle herds in areas where transmission from badgers to cattle had been reduced by badger culling. Continued spatial association of infections in cattle and badgers in such areas might partly reflect transmission from cattle. Synthesis and applications: Our findings confirm that badger culling can prompt spatial spread of M. bovis infection, a phenomenon likely to undermine the utility of this approach as a disease control measure. Possible evidence of transmission from cattle, both to other cattle and to badgers, suggests that improved cattle controls might yield multiple benefits for TB management.},

abstract = {The impact of public rights of way on badger setts was examined in the Bradford area of West Yorkshire using comparisons of 38 setts surveyed in 1985-1996 and again in 1992-1993. Badger setts were compared on the basis of whether they were still in use or not, and on the number of illegal disturbance events recorded over the study period. The number of, and distance from, public accesses did not influence sett persistence, and the least frequently disturbed setts (i.e. those with an average of one or less disturbance incidents every 2 years) were closer to a larger number of accesses. Frequency of poaching was high near to heavily disturbed setts and those no longer occupied at the later survey. Less frequently disturbed setts were associated with landowners who were unsupportive of badger conservation: it is possible that such landowners are highly protective of their land and thus incidentally reduce the frequency of poaching and other forms of disturbance. Setts in areas with formal authorized shooting were less disturbed. Setts still in use tended to be: in open habitats and visible from roads and nearby dwellings. Setts in open areas were less often disturbed than those in wooded sites. Since public access may not reduce sett persistence and may even be beneficial in an area of high wilful persecution, there are implications for the management of public access.},

abstract = {Numbers of European hares Lepus europaeus have declined throughout Europe due to agricultural intensification. However, hares are more common in intensive arable areas than in pastural areas. To identify factors limiting populations, functional explanations for differences in density of hares were sought. We compared demography (litter size, prenatal mortality and participation in breeding by females), body condition (urinary and serum nitrogen, kidney fat, bone marrow fat, skeletal size and body weight), and dietary quality of hares from parts of England and Wales where they are present at relatively high densities (arable habitats) and at relatively low densities (pastural habitats). In pastural areas a lower proportion of adult females were lactating in late winter than in arable areas. Recruitment was therefore lower in pastural than in arable habitats. Hares from pastural areas were smaller, lighter and had less fat than those from arable areas, but dietary quality was similar. Thus hares in low-density populations from pastural areas were able to obtain a good-quality diet, but expended more energy and were unable to maintain body condition as well as those from arable areas. Pastural habitat, which in England and Wales is relatively warm and wet, is suboptimal for hares. The reduced recruitment and chance of survival of hares in the pastural habitats we describe may explain the differences in density of hares in arable and pastural habitats. Efforts to conserve the hare should focus on the reduction of predation and exposure to unfavourable weather by the provision of year-round vegetative cover (such as fallow land, rough grassland and shelterbelts), to increase the chances of survival of leverets and adult hares.},

Variation in food preferences was not attributable to differences between individuals, but followed a temporal pattern. The variety of foods eaten showed a bimodal pattern with peaks corresponding to the two most active periods at the beginning and end of the night. Both the amount of food eaten and variation in the amount diminished from the first to the second active period. An expected selection for carbohydrates early in the night and proteins at the end of the night was not found, but sugars were selected for early in the night. These results are discussed in relation to the conflict between an animal's continuous energy requirements and the essentially periodic activity of foraging.},

They predict different ratios between adult and juvenile densities, which were tested using trapping data from mixed deciduous woodland and from lowland arable field margins. According to the Adult Aggression Hypothesis, juveniles have a poor persistence rate early in the breeding season as a result of aggressive behaviour shown by the adults. As the breeding season progresses, a drop in adult aggression levels results in increased juvenile persistence, which, in turn, leads to increased densities. The Habitat Saturation Hypothesis proposes that juveniles disperse from their parents' territories until the surrounding habitats are saturated and that this gradual saturation results in increased densities as the breeding season progresses. The observed correlations between adult and juvenile densities both in woodland and on field margins were consistent with the predictions of the Habitat Saturation Hypothesis.},

abstract = {For small mammals that are vulnerable to predation, the protection provided by physical structuring within the habitat is important in determining suitable nest or resting sites but little is known about how different aspects of structure affect use of the habitat more generally. We examined the effects of ground-level structure (open/complex), overhead cover (present/absent) and the distribution of protected nest sites and food (clumped together/scattered) on activity and use of space among house mice, Mus domesticus, in enclosures. Adult pairs were housed in eight habitat types differing in arrangement of nestboxes, bricks and cover sheets, and their location was monitored under infrared light every 0.5 s over 4 h during the dark period. The mice spent much more time within protected nest sites and were more restricted in use of different sites within habitats that had little ground-level structure and no overhead cover. Much wider use was made of structurally complex habitats. Complex ground-level structure had the greatest impact on emergence from protected nest sites and use of space, since mice preferred to stay close to, or on top of, walls and other objects when undisturbed. The influence of overhead cover on normal activity depended on the extent of ground-level structure and origin of the mice, but, when disturbed by an experimenter, mice sheltered under overhead cover or in enclosed nest sites. Preference between nest sites depended on accessibility from under overhead cover and proximity to enclosure walls. We found almost no sex differences in activity or use of space.

journal = {Journal of Zoology},

abstract = {One of the hypotheses proposed to account for why badgers Meles meles are highly social in the U.K., the resource dispersion hypothesis, is that patchy resources are unpredictably dispersed in the environment and therefore must be shared, but that these patches are rich enough, when available, to support several badgers at any one time. Previous empiricists in our study site at Wytham Woods calculated that single patches could be rich enough to support 30 badgers in a night. The sustained increase in population density in Wytham Woods suggests that food was riot limiting and territories were below capacity, and therefore that feeding competition was relatively low. Low feeding competition would predict an absence of dimorphism in trophic apparatus between the sexes. Contrary to this, significant sexual dimorphism was found, after removing effects resulting from body size allometry, in canine cross-section length, width (both P < 0.0001) and skull breadth (P < 0.001). The differences in canine dimensions were still significant when allometry of both body length and skull breadth are accounted for statistically (P < 0.0001). It is therefore suggested that feeding competition may not necessarily be low, which would have implications for understanding the costs of social behaviour. Alternative explanations involving sexual selection and phylogenetic inertia are discussed.},

abstract = {Badgers (Meles meles) have been the focus for the development of a pervasive model of social grouping behaviour, relevant to a number of carnivore species and other taxonomic groups - the Resource Dispersion Hypothesis (RDH). The RDH hypothesises that the dispersion and richness of resources in the environment provide a passive mechanism for the formation of groups,- even without any direct benefits of group living. However, few studies have tested-the RDH in the field. The principal prediction is that, as opposed to enlargement of territory sizes to accommodate more members, territory size (TS) is independent of group size (GS). Instead, TS is determined by the spatial dispersion of resources, while GS is independently determined by the richness of those resources. However, these predictions provide only weak correlative tests, especially in non-experimental field studies. The first predicts an absence of correlation and is therefore prone to Type II error, especially given the small sample sizes and errors in estimating TS and GS of mammals in the field. We tested for independence of territory size and group size in all years with available data since the beginning of the long-term badger study in Wytham Woods in 1974. We used two methods of TS estimation, a sequential Bonferroni technique to adjust for multiple inference tests, a combined analysis and an analysis with pooled data. This prediction of the RDH could not be rejected on the basis of any of these analyses. Given this evidence that other processes are independently determining group size and territory size, further predictions of the RDH will be worth investigating in considerable detail.},

abstract = {(1) The diet of the bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum was analysed from faeces and prey remains from feeding sites through one breeding season. Light traps measured prey availability. (2) Previous studies have indicated opportunistic feeding, but rhinolophids use echolocation which may interpret insect wingbeat characteristics to select insect types (e.g. according to taxa, size). (3) R. ferrumequinum selectively dismembered large prey at perches, reducing energy costs. The diet varied over the season and consisted mainly of Lepidoptera (40.61% by volume) and Coleoptera (33.24%). Hymenoptera and Diptera were taken. More large items than expected by chance could result from the bats' acoustic search fields, or from selection. (4) More males than females of the cockchafer M. melolontha were eaten in May-June. The diet was most diverse in spring and autumn, when preferred prey items (moths) were scarce, and narrowest during late pregnancy, when moths constituted most of the diet. (5) R. ferrumequinum conforms to optimal foraging models for predators sensitive to the environment: selection for prey size, and rejection of unprofitable prey (Diptera and ichneumonids) except when more profitable prey (moths) were scarce was apparent. R. ferrumequinum certainly does not forage opportunistically.},

pages = {303-312},
abstract = {The noctule Nyctalus noctula (Schreber, 1774) is a relatively large (c. 25 g) insectivorous bat which catches insects on the wing (by aerial hawking). Emergence at a maternity roost was earliest relative to sunset when females were lactating, and bats may then have risked predation by flying at higher light levels during a period of high energy demand. Flight performance was quantified by using stereophotogrammetry. At feeding sites bats flew at 6.0 +/- 2.1 m/s. This was faster than predicted minimum power speed (V-mp), and either between V-mp and maximum range speed (V-mr), or close to their predicted V-mr, depending on which aerodynamic model of flight power requirements was used. The echolocation behaviour of noctules is flexible. Long duration, low frequency calls (c. 20 kHz) with little frequency modulation were emitted while cruising, but at foraging sites the calls became more frequency-modulated. As the noctule is traditionally thought of as using low frequency echolocation, it was expected to receive weak echoes from small targets and therefore to specialize in eating large insect prey. Although the bats ate mainly beetles, large numbers of small dipterans were also eaten. The noctule is probably able to detect such small items because, when foraging, its calls become broadband and sweep from high frequencies. Higher harmonics are also present, and these may assist in the detection of small prey. In noctules, as in many bats, there appears to be a 1:1 link between wingbeat and call production during the search phase of foraging.},

abstract = {Bat echolocation calls provide remarkable examples of 'good design' through evolution by natural selection. Theory developed from acoustics and sonar engineering permits a strong predictive basis for understanding echolocation performance. Call features, such as frequency, bandwidth, duration and pulse interval are all related to ecological niche. Recent technological breakthroughs have aided our understanding of adaptive aspects of call design in free-living bats. Stereo videogrammetry, laser scanning of habitat features and acoustic flight path tracking permit reconstruction of the flight paths of echolocating bats relative to obstacles and prey in nature. These methods show that echolocation calls are among the most intense airborne vocalizations produced by animals. Acoustic tracking has clarified how and why bats vary call structure in relation to flight speed. Bats using broadband echolocation calls adjust call design in a range-dependent manner so that nearby obstacles are localized accurately. Recent phylogenetic analyses based on gene sequences show that particular types of echolocation signals have evolved independently in several lineages of bats. Call design is often influenced more by perceptual challenges imposed by the environment than by phylogeny, and provides excellent examples of convergent evolution. Now that whole genome sequences of bats are imminent, understanding the functional genomics of echolocation will become a major challenge.},

Call frequency and neural processing are both flexible within individual bats which use this mode of echolocation. The simple structure of the calls makes them ideal for sonagraphic analysis. Here, in a large-scale and long-term analysis of changes in the vocalizations of bats we show that: (i) the calls of R. ferrumequinum aged 1-28 years vary seasonally and over a lifetime in a predictable manner: and (ii) an infant's RF is at least partly determined by the RF of its mother. We consider the relative importance of genetic and learning factors upon the correlation between RFS of mothers and offspring.},

abstract = {1. Echolocation and foraging behavior of the horseshoe bats Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and R. hipposideros feeding under natural conditions are described. 2. The calls of both species consisted predominantly of a long CF segment, often initiated and terminated by brief FM sweeps of substantial bandwidth. 3. R. hipposideros typically flew close to vegetation, and fed by aerial hawking, gleaning and by pouncing on prey close to the ground. R. hipposideros called with a CF segment close to 112 kHz which is the second harmonic of the vocalization; its calls included low intensity primary harmonics, and had prominent initial and terminal FM sweeps of considerable bandwidth. When searching for prey on the wing it had longer interpulse intervals than R. ferrumequinum, but emitted shorter pulses at a higher repetition rate; overall it had a similar duty cycle to R. ferrumequinum. 4. R. ferrumequinum, calling with a CF segment close to 83 kHz, also used harmonics other than the dominant secondary in its calls, and modified its echolocation according to ecological conditions. This species showed certain parallels with R. rouxi of Asia. It was observed feeding by aerial hawking and by flycatching. When scanning for prey from a perch (perch hunting), calls were of shorter duration, and interpulse intervals were on average longer, than when bats were flying. Mean duty cycle was longer in flight, and the bandwidths and frequency sweep rates of the FM segments in the calls increased in comparison with perched bats. 5. FM information may facilitate determination of target range and the location and nature of obstacles; it may also be involved in the interpretation of echoes and the detection of moving targets among clutter. The rising FM sweep initiating the call in both species when flying (and to a lesser extent perch hunting) in the wild must have a significant adaptive role, and should be considered an essential component of the call; rhinolophids should be termed ‘FM/CF/FM’ bats.},

pages = {447-457},
abstract = {Ecological constraints often shape the echolocation pulses emitted by bat species. Consequently some (but not all) bats emit species-specific echolocation pulses. Because echolocation pulses are often intense and emitted at high rates, they are potential targets for eavesdropping by other bats. Echolocation pulses can also vary within species according to sex, body size, age, social group and geographic location. Whether these features can be recognised by other bats can only be determined reliably by playback experiments, which have shown that echolocation pulses do provide sufficient information for the identification of sex and individual in one species. Playbacks also show that bats can locate conspecifics and heterospecifics at foraging and roost sites by eavesdropping on echolocation pulses. Guilds of echolocating bat species often partition their use of pulse frequencies. Ecology, allometric scaling and phylogeny play roles here, but are not sufficient to explain this partitioning. Evidence is accumulating to support the hypothesis that frequency partitioning evolved to facilitate intraspecific communication. Acoustic character displacement occurs in at least one instance. Future research can relate genetic population structure to regional variation in echolocation pulse features and elucidate those acoustic features that most contribute to discrimination of individuals.},

abstract = {The Pipistrellus bat Pipistrellus pipistrellus is the most widespread in Europe, and is often the most abundant bat species in northern and central Europe. P. pipistrellus has traditionally been considered as one species throughout Europe. Here we show that: (i) the echolocation calls of pipistrelles fall into two distinct frequency bands in Britain, with frequencies containing most energy averaging 46 kHz and 55 kHz; (ii) roosts consist of bats which use only one form of echolocation; (iii) small but significant differences in average gross morphology exist between the phonic types; and (iv) the two phonic types occur in sympatry over much of Britain. Recordings made from European populations show that bimodal echolocation is also typical of continental pipistrelles, with only one phonic type found in some areas, two types in sympatry in others. The sympatric occurrence of two phonic types, the lack of mixing of types between colonies, and the morphological divergence between phonic types suggests that P. pipistrellus may actually consist of at least two cryptic sibling species. The evolution of bimodal echolocation in bats is discussed, and a model involving disruptive selection is presented to show how sympatric speciation may occur.},

Of the 256 roosts at which the species present was identified, the majority, 127 (49.6%) were P. pipistrellus, with a mean maternity roost size of 69.6 bats. A minimum population density of 12.6 bats km(-2) was estimated for P. pipistrellus, based on summer (maternity) roosts. The minimum population density estimate was higher than previous studies in northern England but substantially lower than those reported in Scotland (18.2 bats km(-2)). The combined density of M. mystacinus, M. brandtii, and P. pipistrellus, which have similar foraging styles (15.8 bats km(-2)), is comparable to Scottish P. pipistrellus densities. The density of M. daubentonii was also lower than in Scotland, although the density of P. auritus was comparable. The majority of summer roosts for all species were found in buildings, except N. noctula and M. daubentonii which used bridges/tunnels or trees.},

pages = {302-311},
abstract = {Paratuberculosis (Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis; Map) is a widespread and difficult disease to control in livestock populations and also has possible links to Crohn's disease in humans. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been identified recently as the key wildlife species in terms of paratuberculosis transmission to the wider host community. Here, we test the hypothesis that Map can persist in rabbit populations for extended periods of time in the absence of any external source of infection. A spatially explicit stochastic simulation model of a generic host-disease interaction was developed to quantify the interplay between vertical and horizontal routes of transmission needed for the persistence of Map in rabbit populations and to test the hypothesis. The model was parameterized based on empirical studies on rabbit population dynamics and on rabbit-to-rabbit routes of Map transmission. Predictions from the model suggest that any disease with susceptible-infected (SI) dynamics without disease-induced mortality can persist within a rabbit population in the absence of vertical transmission, providing the horizontal transmission coefficient, beta, is greater than approximately 0.012. The inclusion of any vertical transmission reduces the value of beta that is necessary for infection to persist. Paratuberculosis persists in rabbit populations at all values of the horizontal and vertical transmission parameters in the range estimated from the field data and in many cases at all values within 95% confidence intervals around this range. The persistence of Map infection in rabbit populations in the absence of external sources of infection suggests that they may act as a reservoir of infection for sympatric livestock. Synthesis and applications. Our findings, in combination with the ubiquitous distribution of rabbits in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, suggests that if Map becomes established in rabbit populations they are likely to provide widespread and persistent environmental distributions of infection and thus disease risk to livestock and potentially humans. Where local rabbit populations are infected they should be included in any future paratuberculosis control strategies. Because eradication of rabbits is often not a realistic option, control strategies should include reducing interspecific transmission risk from rabbits to livestock via the faecal-oral route.},

Hornbeam Carpinus betulus, willow Salix caprea, sweet chestnut Castanea sativa and birch Betula pubescens were the most susceptible to browsing from roe. On sites browsed by fallow deer, levels of damage were highest on sweet chestnut, ash Fraxinus excelsior and lime Tilia cordata. Higher damage levels were associated with a greater density/activity of roe deer as evinced by dung counts; there was no clear relationship within woodlands frequented by fallow. On freshly cut coppice (< 1 year), level of damage decreased as overall size of the block increased (p < 0.05); a higher level of damage was sustained in blocks adjacent to cover habitats. Damage by fallow deer, but not by roe, was also affected by the degree of protection offered to individual stools. Only three coppice blocks studied were fenced; this protection proved the single most effective measure in reducing damage. The practical options for reducing damage by manipulating the habitat and coppice management practice are discussed.},

abstract = {There is very little known about the post-release survival of hand-reared pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus spp). We radio-tracked 12 pipistrelle bats, hand-reared and released under three different protocols: i) limited pre-release flight training and over wintering (n = 5); ii) prolonged pre-release flight training, but with limited space (n = 2) and iii) prolonged pre-release flight training in large flight cage (n = 5). Of the five bats reared under the first protocol, four were recovered, grounded, within 48 h and the signal from the fifth bat lost on day two, due either to tag failure or from the bat flying out of the study area. Both bats in the second group flew strongly on the night of release but on the second and third nights only one emerged and flew briefly. The signals from both bats remained stationary on subsequent nights. In contrast, bats from the third group were tracked for between five and ten nights, indicating that they were able to survive independently following release. These preliminary results suggest that post-release survival depends on extensive pre-release conditioning in a large flight cage, rather than the limited flight opportunities traditionally provided within domestic houses by bat carers. Other factors that may affect post-release survival are discussed and further work is encouraged to determine whether rehabilitated bats integrate with the local population.},

Ten bats (five common and five soprano pipistrelles) were radio-tracked for between one and ten days. Three of these were retrieved after one, two and four days, respectively. In addition, five of the 39 (13%) ringed bats returned to their release boxes between 38 and 1,389 days after release, at least two of which survived over the winter in the wild. A sixth ringed bat was retrieved 27 days after release after becoming trapped in a house. We also identified potential barriers to successful rehabilitation. Two of the ten bats radio-tracked in the current project became trapped within buildings and another bat had to be retrieved following entanglement with debris. We therefore recommend that attention be paid to giving bats the opportunity, prior to release, in identifying and using small exit holes similar to those found in buildings and loft spaces. We also recommend allowing bats to self-release following prolonged pre-release flight training in a large flight cage situated in suitable bat habitat.},

Survival after release was lower than for the grey squirrels: of 11 red squirrels that survived at least a week, only three survived more than three months and none for four months. More than half were eaten or cached by predators, mainly foxes; an experiment with grey squirrel carcasses indicated that they had been killed, not scavenged after death.

Data on overlap of core ranges, and reluctance of red squirrels to enter traps used by grey squirrels in the mixed population, indicated interference competition between the two species, with grey squirrels possibly dominant.

Densities and productivity correlated with tree seed crops for both squirrel species in deciduous and conifer habitats. Productivity was reduced by high density of full-grown squirrels relative to seed abundance. In oak-hazel woods, demography of grey squirrels correlated with abundance of acorns but not of hazel-nuts, whereas density and productivity of red squirrels correlated with hazel-nut abundance. Correlations of female density and productivity with pine-cone crops did not differ between red and grey squirrels, Predators ate many radio-tagged grey squirrels in conifers, and annual survival was only 50% compared with 80-82% for both species in other habitats. Grey squirrel populations in southern conifer sites were sustained by immigration, and at northern sites female density correlated with oak abundance within 500 m. Failure to exploit acorn crops puts red squirrels at a competitive disadvantage in deciduous woodland.

abstract = {Diffusion modelling has shown that conservative demographic traits combined with feeding competition could explain red squirrel replacement by grey squirrels. We used field data from seven separate red and grey squirrel populations, in oak-hazel woods and Scots pines, to reject the hypothesis that red squirrel density and breeding is intrinsically poorer than that of grey squirrels. In oak-hazel woods, grey squirrel foraging, density and productivity were related to oak and acorn abundance. In contrast, red squirrels foraged where hazels were abundant; their relatively low density and breeding success were related to the abundance of hazel nuts. Red squirrels failed to exploit good acorn crops, although acorns were more abundant than hazels, but in Scots pines had densities and breeding success as high as grey squirrels in deciduous woods. Captive grey squirrels thrived on a diet of acorns, but red squirrels had a comparative digestive efficiency of only 59%, apparently because they were much less able than grey squirrels to neutralize acorn polyphenols. A model with simple competition for the autumn hazel crop, which was eaten by grey squirrels before the acorn crop, shows that red squirrels are unlikely to persist with grey squirrels in woods with more than 14% oak canopy. With oaks in most British deciduous woods giving grey squirrels a food refuge which red squirrels fail to exploit, replacement of red squirrels can be explained by feeding competition alone, exacerbated by the post-war decline in coppiced hazel.},

abstract = {The chemical composition of the volatile components of the anal gland secretion of mature and immature moles of both sexes was examined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The compounds in the secretion of adult males appear to vary little throughout the year and are similar to those from the adult female outside the breeding season. The secretions are dominated by C-5-C-10 carboxylic acids. Female glands regress as they enter proestrus, accompanied by profound changes in the chemical composition of the secretion with early disappearance of the carboxylic acids. In juvenile moles, the compostion of the secretion changes as the animal matures, with carboxylic acids becoming dominant only as the animal reaches maturity. Anal gland secretion probably plays an important role in territorial maintenance.},

abstract = {Population monitoring is important for conservation management but difficult to achieve for rare, cryptic species. Reliable information about the Critically Endangered Scottish wildcat Felis silvestris silvestris is lacking because of difficulties in morphological and genetic identification, resulting from extensive hybridization with feral domestic cats Felis catus. We carried out camera-trap surveys in the Cairngorms National Park, UK, to examine the feasibility of camera trapping, combined with a pelage identification method, to monitor Scottish wildcats. Camera trapping detected individually identifiable wildcats. Of 13 individual wild-living cats, four scored as wildcats based on pelage characters and the rest were wildcat x domestic cat hybrids. Spatially explicit capture-recapture density estimation methods generated a density of wild-living cats (wildcats and hybrids) of 68.17 +/- SE 9.47 per 100 km(2). The impact of reducing trapping-grid size, camera-trap numbers and survey length on density estimates was investigated using spatially explicit capture-recapture models. Our findings indicate camera trapping is more effective for monitoring wildcats than other methods currently used and capture success could be increased by using bait, placing camera stations <= 1.5 km apart, increasing the number of camera stations, and surveying for 60-70 days. This study shows that camera trapping is effective for confirming the presence of the wildcat in potential target areas for conservation management.},

abstract = {The wildcat in Scotland, UK, is currently at risk of extinction because of hybridization with feral domestic cats (ferals) and hybrids (wildcat x domestic cat crosses). Conservation efforts are hampered by limited information on the distribution of these three cat types and the spatial variation in hybridization risk. From January 2010 to July 2013, we conducted widespread camera-trapping surveys throughout northern Scotland to document the distribution of ferals, hybrids, and wildcats. Using single-season occupancy models, we predicted the probability of occupancy for these three cat types across Scotland. Over 49,031 camera-trapping days, we had 87 captures (photo of a cat at a camera-trap station within a 24-h period) of wildcats, 145 captures of hybrids, and 193 captures of ferals. At over 48 % of the camera-trap stations where we detected wildcats, we also detected ferals or hybrids. We predicted wildcat occupancy as a function of habitat co-variates. Wildcat occupancy probability increased in habitat with a higher proportion of mixed woodland habitat and decreased in habitat with more edge (transition from closed to open habitats). Hybrids showed a clear overlap in their distribution pattern with both ferals and wildcats. The results indicate that wildcats in Scotland are at risk of hybridization across much of their current distribution from ferals and/or hybrids. In particular, hybrids have an increased probability of occupying much of the same habitat as wildcats compared to ferals, supporting recent suggestions that hybrids may pose a significant additional hybridization threat by facilitating gene flow between wildcats and ferals.},

abstract = {The Active Territorial Defense Hypothesis (ATDH) and Passive Range Exclusion Hypothesis (PREH) are contrasted as possible explanations for patterns of latrine use in a high-density population of the European badger (Meles meles) in the United Kingdom. Using bait-marking techniques, temporal patterns in latrine use by individuals and social groups were investigated to test for any systematic marking behavior, especially whether coordination of individual actions might be involved in the group territorial marking strategy. Latrine use by 4 groups was concentrated primarily along territory boundaries and particularly along parts of the boundary closer to that group's sett, rather than closer to active feeding areas. Boundary latrines were used to a similar extent by each group, with a consistent percentage (but differing subset) of a group's boundary latrines used daily. Individually, badgers preferentially used certain latrines and male badgers, in particular, showed a tendency to deposit more feces in latrines closer to their group sett. Our results indicate that badgers partition the collective responsibility of marking their territories, with the result that their entire boundaries are marked regularly and consistently, regardless of where focal individuals may be feeding. Individuals did not simply defecate at the section of boundary closest to where they happened to be active, but rather according to a pattern resulting in comprehensive, regular group coverage of the border. The patterns of latrine use accorded more closely with the ATDH than the PREH. This study provides evidence that badgers may cooperate systematically to defend their territories.},

The relationship between land use and both temporal trends, and spatial patterns, in brown hare sightings across England and Wales was examined using data collected between the 1985/86 and 2004/05 hunting seasons. Hare sightings increased significantly during this period, with an average increase of 2.81 hare sightings per hunting day across all hunts since 1985. Sightings were more frequent in eastern England, where arable land is abundant, than in the rest of England and Wales which is predominantly pastoral. There was no correlation between temporal trends in hare sightings and land use change. Patterns observed using the hunt sighting data are similar to those reported by other concurrent studies that used different methods. We conclude that hunt sightings could contribute useful data to a national monitoring scheme.},

abstract = {Commercial plantations are primarily managed for timber production, and are frequently considered poor for biodiversity, particularly for mammalian species. Bats, which constitute one fifth of mammal species worldwide, have undergone large declines throughout Europe, most likely due to widespread habitat loss and degradation. Bat use of modified landscapes such as urban or agricultural environments has been relatively well Studied, however, intensively managed plantations have received less attention, particularly in Europe. We assessed three of the largest, most intensively managed plantations in the UK for the occurrence of bats, activity levels and relative abundance in response to environmental characteristics at multiple spatial scales, using an information theoretic approach. We recorded or captured nine species; Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus were the most commonly recorded species on acoustic detectors and female P. pygmaeus were the most commonly captured. The influence of environmental characteristics on bat activity varied by species or genus, although all bat species avoided dense stands. Occurrence and activity of clutter and edge adapted species were associated with lower stand densities and more heterogeneous landscapes whereas open adapted bats were more likely to be recorded at felled stands and less likely in areas that were predominantly mature conifer woodland. In addition, despite morphological similarities, P. pipstrellus and P. pygmaeus were found foraging in different parts of the plantation. This study demonstrates that with sympathetic management, non-native conifer plantations may have an important role in maintaining and supporting bat populations, particularly for Pipistrellus spp. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In 1995 Scottish Natural Heritage proposed a feasibility study to examine the case for reintroducing the Eurasian Beaver Castor fiber to Scotland. Following IUCN guidelines, an important first step is to demonstrate that the Beaver was once a native of Scotland and that the causes of its extinction no longer pose any threat to reintroduced animals. Therefore, palaeontological, archaeological and historical evidence for the former existence of the Beaver in Scotland and the causes of its extinction are reviewed. Palaeontological and archaeological evidence suggest that the Eurasian Beaver was once widely distributed throughout mainland Scotland. Historical evidence suggests that although it was once probably fairly common, it became extinct between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries, most probably towards the latter. The main cause of its decline and extinction was probably hunting for its pelt, meat and castoreum, but habitat destruction may have been important in the loss of some small isolated populations. Given that the causes of extinction of the Beaver in Scotland now no longer exist or can be effectively controlled, there is no reason why a feasibility study cannot proceed to assess the practicalities of a reintroduction.},

abstract = {Feedback between population density and demographic parameters often plays a determining role in population dynamics, and it is particularly important in managing exploited or harvested populations. The mountain hare Lepus timidus is a traditional game species, which is hunted in Scotland for sport and population control. However, information about how population parameters respond to changes in population density is lacking. To assess how reproduction and juvenile recruitment change in response to population density, we sampled 189 hares (88 females and 101 males) from 10 independent private hunting estates. We found a significant negative correlation between population density and the proportion of juveniles recruited into the breeding population, along with a significant interaction between population density and sex, which revealed that the proportion of juvenile females recruited decreases more rapidly with population density compared to the proportion of male juveniles. However, we found no evidence of density-dependent fecundity. Our results suggest density-dependent compensation in this species, acting on recruitment, not fecundity, with rates of juvenile recruitment differing between the sexes. We conclude that the significant correlation between population density and juvenile recruitment may provide harvested populations with the potential for compensatory juvenile recruitment, although harvesting rates need to be accurately estimated to avoid the risk of overharvesting.},

(3) Throughout the year most adult rabbits were in burrows, although some individuals were occasionally to be found on the surface. This was more frequent with males. Juvenile rabbits were more likely to be on the surface than adults during the summer, and were less inclined to bolt to burrows when scared. (4) Most young rabbits on the surface during the late summer gradually took to living in burrows in the autumn. The youngest ones stayed out longest, and one young female remained on the surface throughout the winter. (5) While very few points on the dunes were more than 10 m from an open burrow, scared rabbits bolted up to 80 m before entering holes. (6) Individual rabbits varied a great deal in their fidelity to particular burrows. This was related to the proportion of times they were found on the surface and the amount of movement they showed. (7) Movements by rabbits were greatest in the autumn, the biggest change in activity being shown by adult females between the breeding and non-breeding season. (8) The results are discussed in relation to the roles of social behaviour and predation in determining burrow use by rabbits on sand dunes, and in relation to the effectiveness of gassing burrows as a method of rabbit control in these areas.},

Rabbits found on the surface were disturbed to see whether they bolted to burrows or stayed on the surface.

Even when rabbits did bolt to burrows they frequently left them shortly afterwards and returned to the cover of the broom. Males that were most often found on the surface were lighter in weight than those found in burrows. This was not the case for females.},

(3) The estimated number of juvenile females per 100 adult females attaining the age of first reproduction (2 years old) was 33.7, similar to the estimated proportion of adult females dying annually (31%). (4) The annual number of cubs from nine females varied between four and sixteen. There was a high correlation between prey density (eelpout Zoarces viviparus and rocklings Ciliata mustela) in July-August and numbers of cubs observed over the following months. (5) It is argued that annual variation in numbers of cubs observed was caused by early mortality, and at least part of this was due to females abandoning cubs.},

abstract = {Otters Lutra lutra in Shetland feed almost exclusively in the sea. Their diet was assessed from direct observations of 13, 313 dives, of which 27% were successful, and 2028 prey could be identified. The results are compared with published data on the availability offish for different seasons, time of day, state of tide, and different types of coast. The most frequently taken prey was eelpout Zoarces viviparus (34%), but they were relatively small, and rocklings Ciliata mustela dominated the diet in terms of biomass (18%, against eelpout 15%). Small eel‐shaped, bottom‐living species dominated in the diet at all times, but of those, otters took the larger fishes in the populations (median weight of prey 28 g). The size and species composition of prey of males was the same as that of females with cubs, but females without cubs took smaller fish.

In spring, prey was smaller than at other times, and otters were least successful when diving. Diving success and mean prey weight was highest in winter, although prey availability was highest in summer.

Eelpout were caught mostly along sheltered coasts, rocklings in more exposed areas. It is argued that for optimal exploitation of the seasonal availability of different species of prey, otters need to use different types of coast, and the size of their ranges would be related to the spacing of coastal types.

Most fishes were caught in daytime, and around high tide otters fed less than at other times; hunting therefore took place during periods of inactivity of prey. For the main prey species, Ciliata mustela , it was estimated that otters took a substantial part of the total population.},

abstract = {The dispersion of otters Lutra lutra was studied along the coasts of an area of Shetland. The population was relatively stable, with about one adult otter per kilometre of coast. They fished diurnally in a strip of water usually within 100 m of the shore. Females lived in exclusive group ranges, occupied by up to four females, with well-defined boundaries which were respected by successive occupants. For two groups, where relatively complete information was available, range size was 4.7 and 6.4 km, occupied by two and four females, respectively; a third range was about 14 km, with possibly 4-5 females. Within the group ranges individual females moved on their own or with their cubs. Each had a core area, where they were observed > 50% of the time; these core areas were separate from each other, although each individual used the entire group range. Several or all females in each range bred in any one summer. Male ranges were larger than those of females, and overlapped with two or more female group ranges; there were several resident males along each section of coast, but the information on males was incomplete. The habitats of the sexes were different; males spent more time on exposed coasts than did females. There were frequent visits to all coasts from non-resistant otters of both sexes. Behavioural interactions related to territoriality are described; otters showed little overt aggression, except between adult males, but there was some individual avoidance. It is argued that the survival value of this spatial organization can be understood in terms of resource dispersion, but several types of resources have to be considered (including prey and fresh water), and detailed predictions of spatial organization from resource dispersion are unwarranted.},

(3) Badgers caught worms on the surface at night; when feeding in grassland, their foraging efficiency was related to grass length. (4) Within their ranges, badgers avoided pasture with long grass and with relatively low worm densities. (5) It might be possible to make badgers avoid cattle-grazed pasture by reducing worm populations chemically, or by increasing grass length by a different grazing routine. This could be effective in preventing the contamination of cattle by badgers with bovine tuberculosis.

abstract = {The effects of water temperature (T-w) on core body temperature (T-b) and foraging behaviour were studied in four free-ranging and one captive otter Lutra lutra in NE Scotland. The free-ranging animals were observed in and around two freshwater lochs, and measurements were made of T-w (2-16 degrees C), T-b at the beginning and end of swimming bouts, lengths of swimming bouts, and dive times and intervals. T-b ranged from 35.9 to 40.4 degrees C (mean 38.1 degrees C). At the beginning of a period of activity and of a swimming bout, T-b rose significantly; during swimming it fell at a rate of 2.3 degrees C/h, independent of T-w. Dive intervals were longer in colder waters, but this was probably due to other, seasonal environmental changes (perhaps water level). T-w had no significant effect on length of swimming bouts or on T-b. Although otters entered water with increased T-b, they exited when T-b was not significantly different from the mean resting T-b. The data suggest that otters maintain T-b irrespective of T-w, by increasing it before entering water, then either exiting at a given T-b, Or at an earlier time determined by other environmental conditions.},

Although this prediction extends to the effects of early development on fitness, few studies have documented early determinants of lifetime reproductive success in a natural mammal population. In this paper, to describe factors affecting the reproductive success of male and female red deer (Cervus elaphus) on the island of Rum, Scotland. Birthweight was a significant determinant of total lifetime reproductive success in males, with heavier-born males being more successful than lighter ones. In contrast, birthweight did not affect female reproductive success. High population density and cold spring temperatures in the year of birth decreased several components of fitness in females, but did not affect the breeding success of males. The results confirm the prediction that selection on a sexually dimorphic trait should be greater in males than in females, and explain the differential maternal expenditure between sons and daughters observed in red deer. Differences between the sexes in the effects of environmental and phenotypic variation on fitness may generate differences in the amount of heritable genetic variation underlying traits such as birthweight.},

abstract = {Accurate wildlife population density estimates are important for conservation purposes, but can be difficult to obtain where species are elusive or rare. We use individual genotypes derived from hair samples and Spatially Explicit Capture Recapture (SECR) models to estimate the population density of European pine marten (Martes manes) and examine the effects of forest fragmentation on population size. We take the first steps towards linking the number of scats in an area to population density, which may eventually negate the need for expensive genetic analyses in the future. Population density estimates ranged from 0.07 km(-2)(95% CI 0.03-0.16) to 0.38 km(-2)(95% CI 0.11-1.07), which were mid to low compared to other estimates from Scotland. We found support for the previous finding that pine marten density in Scotland increases with forest fragmentation up to a threshold level (20-35% forest cover), beyond which it decreases. We found a non-linear relationship between scat counts and population density, although this relationship may be biased by factors not included in the analysis and should be viewed with caution. Following the recent re-inforcement of pine martens to Wales, non-invasive genetic sampling for population estimation may provide an effective way of monitoring their progress.},

abstract = {1. Norway rat Rattus norvegicus populations are usually controlled with toxic baits, but this approach is increasingly recognized as having negative welfare and environmental impacts. An integrated strategy that relies less on rodenticides is therefore required. Here we investigate the possibility of using a resource-based approach to rat population management. 2. Structurally complex habitats provide rat populations with nest sites and opportunities to avoid predators; modifying habitats to reduce structural complexity might reduce their potential to support rat populations. As part of an integrated approach, this could be more sustainable than relying exclusively on lethal control. However, in order to target habitat management efforts most effectively with minimum impact on other species, an understanding of habitat utilization by Norway rats is required. 3. In this study, rat populations on farms in the north-east of England were monitored by radio-tracking and population counts before and after a single phase of habitat modification. Rats living near farm buildings utilized areas with high levels of cover; habitat modification reduced the survival rate and size of these rat populations. Rats living in field margins also preferred areas with high levels of cover, but they had significantly bigger home ranges than rats living near farm buildings and were largely unaffected by small-scale habitat management. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that habitat management near farm buildings has the potential to reduce the size of rat populations. As part of an integrated approach, this technique offers a way of reducing reliance on rodenticides. Habitat use by rats within the wider farm landscape suggests that land management practices have the potential to influence the size and distribution of rat populations; many game-rearing practices and environmental policies designed to create habitats for 'desirable' farm wildlife, inadvertently create desirable habitats for rats.},

Population cycles were broadly synchronous at all sites, but use of Mantel correlations suggested a strong spatial pattern along one axis at a projection line 72 degrees from North. We then fitted a generalized additive model to log population density assuming a fixed-form travelling wave in one spatial dimension for which the density at each site was offset in time by a constant amount from a standard density-time curve. We assumed that the magnitude of this offset would be proportional to the spatial separation between any given site and the centroid of the sampling sites, where separation is the distance between sites in a fixed direction. After fitting this model, we estimated that the wave moved at an average speed of 19 km yr(-1) heading from West to East at an angle of 78 degrees from North. Nomadic avian predators which could synchronize populations over large areas are scarce and the travelling wave may be caused by density-dependent dispersal by field voles and/or predation by weasels, both of which act at a suitably small spatial scale.},

pages = {106-118},
abstract = {1. A geographical gradient in the relative impact of generalist and specialist predators on small rodent populations has been hypothesized to be responsible for the gradient in cyclicity found in Fennoscandia. Population oscillations resulting from weasel-vole interactions are said to be dampened by the increasing stabilizing impact of generalist predators in southern Fennoscandia resulting from: (i) a greater abundance and diversity of predators sustained by alternative prey; (ii) the absence of significant snow cover leading to constant exposure of voles to generalist predators; and (iii) a heterogeneous habitat that makes dispersing voles more vulnerable to predators. 2. Changes in the abundance of field voles (Microtus agrestis L.) in a man-made spruce forest in northern England were recorded during 1984-98 using sign indices at 14-18 sites calibrated with capture-recapture estimates of vole density. 3. Field vole populations exhibited cyclic dynamics which were in many ways similar to those reported from Fennoscandia, including population declines taking place during the breeding season and long periods with no recovery in numbers following population crashes. 4. The density dependence structure of the time series was explored by means of partial autocorrelation functions, which suggested second-order density dependence. Analyses based on two density estimates per year (spring and autumn) reveal significant negative values for lags of 1, 1.5 and 2 years, suggesting that the time-lag might be somewhat shorter than 2 years. 5. Estimates of predation on field voles by red foxes and tawny owls at high vole density were above the value predicted for this site and for the whole generalist predator community by a published model assuming that predation by generalist predators stabilizes vole populations. However, empirical estimates of the parameter used both for designing and testing the model are inherently imprecise. 6. A qualitative evaluation of the three variables (see 1) correlated to the Fennoscandian gradient and assumed to contribute to variations in generalist predation pressure did not support the hypothesis that low predation rates by generalist predators are necessary for vole dynamics to be dominated by the destabilizing impact of weasel-vole interactions. The specialist/generalist predation hypothesis must therefore be modified to account for the regular population cycles occurring in northern Britain.},

abstract = {Differential male reproductive success is commonplace in mammals and frequently attributed to variation in morphological traits that provide individuals with a competitive advantage in female defence mating systems. Other mammalian mating systems, however, have received comparatively little attention and correlates of male reproductive success in them are less well understood. We studied a free-ranging population of North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus Erxleben) exhibiting year-round individual territoriality. Males must temporarily vacate their territories to locate spatially dispersed receptive females, thereby setting the stage for a scramble competition mating system. We predicted that both male annual mating success (measured as the number of females copulated with) and annual reproductive success (measured as the number of offspring sired) would be positively correlated with both search ability (measured as the number of oestrous females located over the mating season) and effort (measured as mating season home range size), generating directional sexual selection on these two metrics. Mating season home ranges of males showed, on average, an almost 10-fold increase relative to those measured during the nonmating season, while those of females showed a more moderate twofold increase and both annual mating and reproductive success of males was positively correlated with search ability and search effort. The spatial dispersion of females, resulting from the strict territorial social structure of red squirrels, gave rise to a predicted scramble competition mating system. Furthermore, the strength of sexual selection on behavioural traits in this mating system equalled previous estimates for morphological traits in female defence mating systems.},

abstract = {Over the last few decades, there have been significant declines in Brown Hare Lepus europaeus numbers throughout Europe, leading to concern for their status in many countries. In Britain, there were no quantified data on the extent of this decline, on current population levels, or any baseline against which to monitor future population changes. The need for a quantified national hare survey led to this evaluation of the techniques available to assess hare numbers. Published information on counting hares is reviewed, and various techniques compared by applying them to a number of sites in southern England. Three basic approaches are available: counts of inactive hares, counts of active hares and indirect methods. Counts of inactive hares include total clearance, wide belt and line transect counts. Total clearance counts give an absolute figure, but are labour intensive and can only be applied to restricted areas. Wide-belt assessments are difficult to apply in certain habitats and even in open areas tend to produce a substantial over-estimate. Line transect counts are easy to undertake and are not labour intensive but should only be applied to large areas, or data from several small areas combined. Counts based on active hares are more problematical, because it is difficult to determine what proportion of the population is inactive at any one time. Spotlight counts based on variable circular plots are the most accurate but difficult to apply widely, and twilight counts are very subjective in their interpretation, especially when surveying small areas or areas with a large proportion of concealing habitats. Of the indirect methods, dung pellet counts can be valuable in specific areas but are difficult to apply across a range of habitats. We concluded that, of the various techniques considered, line transect counts have the greatest potential for a national survey, but need to be stratified so that enough transects are undertaken within each habitat stratum to obtain a reliable mean population estimate for each stratum.},

abstract = {Within two London parks, Richmond and Bushy, both subject to high public visitor pressure, behavioural observations were undertaken to investigate patterns of habitat use by red and fallow deer populations, and to determine the response of the deer to human disturbance. Potentially disturbing events were considered as: i. people present within a distance of < 50m; ii. people present within 50m accompanied by a dog on a lead; iii. dogs within 50m off the lead; iv. people 'crowding' the deer - approaching directly and deliberately for photographs or closer observation; v. actual chases by a dog of the deer group or a member of that group. All the above levels of disturbance caused a measurable change in the immediate behaviour patterns of the deer - reflected in increased levels of vigilance. Females responded more strongly than males of either species. However, the effects were relatively minor and transient in the great majority of cases, with animals resuming their normal activity very quickly after the encounter. Overall daily time-budgets did not differ significantly between undisturbed days and days when disturbance levels were high; nor were any effects apparent on patterns of habitat use by the deer or in forcing the animals to change habitat more frequently. Further, throughout our studies there was no evidence that levels of disturbance caused by public access had any deleterious effects on body-weights or overwinter mortality.},

abstract = {1. This study aimed to develop and test a predictive model of Daubenton's bat Myotis daubentonii distribution and abundance at waterway sites in England and Wales. 2. A preliminary 'core' model to predict Daubenton's bat distribution, developed in 2003 and containing terms relating to biological water quality, waterway width, mean annual discharge and the presence of trees, was re-fitted to more comprehensive datasets. A 'data mining' exercise was conducted after testing the core model, in order to investigate other important variables and to suggest alternative models, with the overall aim of improving the confidence and utility of the results. 3. On average, Daubenton's bat activity was higher on larger waterways with abundant woodland nearby. There was, however, considerable variation in the levels of activity predicted by the models, possibly due to site-specific factors. 4. Daubenton's bat activity was significantly related to aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity, demonstrating the potential relevance of this species as an indicator of a pollution-sensitive biodiversity group. High aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity was associated with good chemical water quality. 5. The analysis demonstrates that Daubenton's bat activity on rivers can be predicted from habitat and water quality data, although the precision of these predictions is low. Where practical, field surveys yield better information. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Population densities of red and roe deer were estimated in 20 conifer plantations throughout central and northern Scotland. Ten forests were selected on the basis of culling records that were considered likely to cover the range of possible densities. Ten further forests were selected at random to investigate the relationship between red and roe deer densities. Density assessment was by standing-crop dung-group counts, on 1.5 x 100 m transects. Dung decay rates were estimated in four areas and used to convert the values to deer densities. Red deer densities were estimated to range from 0.3-35 km(-2): roe deer densities ranged from 0.5-25 km(-2). Preferences for different structural habitats within individual forests (i.e. blocks with different age classes of tree) were inferred from dung densities. Red deer preferred unplanted ground, open-thicket, and prethicket; roe deer likewise preferred prethicket (highly) and open-thicket. Both species avoided closed-canopy habitats. Red and roe deer densities were negatively correlated and the relationship was significant when the data were log transformed (P < 0.05).},

abstract = {The relationship between densities of red and roe deer and a range of environmental variables were investigated. The aim was to assess which factor, or combination of factors, was most associated with, and hence potentially responsible for, variations in densities of deer. Twenty plantation forests throughout Scotland were used as study sites and estimates of deer densities within them were based on dung-group counts. Using ratios of cull records and local information, 10 forests were selected which were expected to give a wide range of deer densities to aid the correlation exercise. The other 10 were selected randomly from within the geographic range of both species and without expectation of density: this allowed deer densities to be used as predictors of each other in the analyses without any bias that selection on the basis of ratio may have introduced. The variables used in analyses included forest habitat structure, climate, vegetation composition, soil type, culling pressure, and the density of other deer species. Red deer densities were positively correlated with mean daily temperature (P < 0.05) throughout the year and mean daily snow depth (P < 0.05) for October through to March, but negatively correlated with mean daily windspeed (P < 0.05) for the quarter April to June. Roe deer density was negatively correlated with mean daily rainfall (P < 0.05) throughout the year. Red deer density was negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with an index of culling pressure, but roe deer density was uncorrelated with this parameter. The actual influence of culling pressure on red deer population density is unclear. Proportions of structural habitats within forests (defined by tree age classes and growth form) were uncorrelated with deer densities, but were secondary predictors of deer density in regression analyses: red deer density was predicted by the proportion of open-thicket (trees aged 15-28 years), and roe deer density by the proportion of restocked areas (0-8 years) and pre-thicket (9-14 years). Stepwise multiple regression analyses suggested that high red deer density has an important negative influence on roe deer density (P < 0.05), but that the reverse did not hold. Possible mechanisms by which significantly correlated variables may influence deer densities are discussed. It is suggested that the differential variation of red and roe deer densities across Scotland may be a result of different climatic adaptations and, possibly, an interspecific influence of red deer on roe deer.},

abstract = {Diets of red Cervus elaphus and roe Capreolus capreolus deer in Scottish plantation forests were assessed by botanical and chemical analyses of 144 rumen samples. Samples were taken for summer and winter from four forests with a range of deer densities and ratios. Red deer ate mainly grasses in summer, and a mixture of sedges, rushes, grasses and heaths (ericoid plants) in winter. Roe deer ate predominantly forbs (herbaceous plants other than graminoids) in summer, and a mixture of forbs, heaths and tree and shrub browse in wister. The two species ate significantly different quantities of forbs and grasses (P < 0.001). Both species ate more grasses and forbs in summer, and more heaths in winter (P < 0.05). There were few differences between forests for either red or roe deer in diet composition or its seasonal variation. Washed rumen contents of rue deer contained more nitrogen than did those of red deer (P < 0.05) in both seasons, and both species contained more nitrogen in summer than in winter (P < 0.05). Proportions of the main plant categories within rumens were compared with their abundance recorded in the ground flora. These comparisons showed roe deer to be highly selective, whilst red deer ate plants in proportions similar to their availability. Niche overlap increased and dietary niche breadths widened during the winter. The main overlap was for heaths Calluna vulgaris is and Vaccinium myrtillus in winter. However, C. vulgaris is widespread and common and competition was considered to be more likely for forbs and possibly V. myrtillus: the use of some forb species by red deer in summer may limit their availability to roe deer in winter, when they remain an important dietary item. Consideration of the different digestive specializations of the two species suggested that any dietary competition is likely to affect roe deer more than red deer.},

abstract = {1. We examined the role of mountain hares in the louping-ill virus/Ixodes ricinus tick system to determine whether hares were reservoirs of these pathogens for red grouse. A field experiment, which involved reducing mountain hare densities was undertaken and changes in tick abundance, louping-ill virus seroprevalence and red grouse densities recorded. 2. Hares were found to be important hosts for all stages of ticks at two study sites and, where sheep were frequently treated with acaricide, hares fed the greatest proportion of adult ticks. Hare densities were reduced at the experimental site between 1993 and 2001 but remained relatively constant at a control site. Both nymph and larvae tick burdens on red grouse chicks declined over this period to very low levels at the treatment site, but not at the control site. The estimated size of the tick population at the treatment site decreased by more than 99% by 1999. 3. Louping-ill prevalence, as measured by antibody prevalence in shot young red grouse, also declined at the treatment site, lagging behind the tick decline by approximately 2 years. The number of young grouse produced per hen grouse at this treatment site increased in comparison to a second control area. However, no change was found in summer grouse densities and thus we cannot demonstrate parasite-mediated competition. 4. A deterministic SIR-type model describing the dynamics of this pathogen/vector/host system was constructed and used to examine the role of mountain hares in louping-ill virus and tick dynamics. The model predicted a decline in tick numbers and seroprevalence as hare densities reduced. The inclusion of hares as both tick hosts and vector-host-vector transmitters of louping-ill virus gave the best fit to the observed data.},

pages = {224-232},
abstract = {1. With the global population of beavers (Castor spp.) increasing, and reintroductions widespread, it is crucial to be able to predict potential impacts on flora and fauna based on defined foraging behaviours. 2. Nymphaea alba (white water lily) is regularly consumed by beavers and provides a model system to test selective foraging behaviour and quantify potential impacts on aquatic resources in standing-water habitats. 3. Using biometric relationships within N.alba pads, we accurately reconstructed the size and weight of consumed pads, demonstrating that beavers (Castor fiber) selected pads that were significantly larger and heavier than unselected pads. By selecting larger leaves, beavers may also avoid chemical defences associated with anthocyanin pigments that dominate in smaller leaves. Grazing was concentrated in shallow depths (55.710.7cm) close to the shore (2.950.62m) relative to ungrazed plots (100.5 +/- 9.2cm; 4.79 +/- 0.68m). The level of selectivity was unchanged with increasing distance from a central feeding place. 4. Beavers removed 24-50% of pads within grazed areas, but relative to the whole N.alba leaf pad resource, the impact of this foraging was low (0.38-1.23% loss). Plant species diversity was unaffected by foraging, and there was no evidence of indirect effects on non-targeted N.alba pads or flowers. 5. When foraging in the aquatic environment, beavers are highly selective and can have a minor effect on food resources whilst feeding optimally and opportunistically. Since beavers demonstrate adaptive foraging strategies depending on their foraging environment, this knowledge should be incorporated into future decisions on further reintroduction or habitat restoration programmes.},

pages = {486-499},
abstract = {1. Small-scale discontinuities, formed by accumulations of wood, are recognised as a key feature of functionally intact forested streams because they promote organic matter retention, increase habitat complexity and provide flow refugia. Re-establishing such features in physically degraded streams is therefore a common priority for restoration schemes. Ecosystem engineering by beavers in the form of dam building might offer a natural mechanism for restoring degraded streams. Despite an increase in beaver reintroductions globally, the ecosystem engineering concept has rarely been applied to restoring biodiversity and ecosystem function, especially within degraded freshwater systems. 2. By comparing multiple beaver-modified and unmodified sites on headwater streams draining 13 ha of pastureland in eastern Scotland, U.K., we investigated if hydromorphological changes caused by reintroduced beavers ( Castor fiber) translate into desirable biological responses when there is a long history of physical degradation and contraction of the regional species pool due to agricultural land use. 3. Beaver modified in-stream habitat by constructing 10 dams, thus creating a series of interconnected dam pools. Organic matter retention and aquatic plant biomass increased ( 7 and 20 fold higher respectively) in beaver ponds relative to unmodified channels, consistent with the lower fluctuation in stream stage observed below a series of dams. Growing season concentrations of extractable P and NO3 were on average 49% and 43% lower respectively below a series of dams than above, although colour and suspended solids concentrations increased. 4. Macroinvertebrate samples from beaver-modified habitats were less taxon rich ( alpha diversity on average 27% lower) than those from unmodified stream habitat. However, due to significant compositional differences between beaver versus unmodified habitats, a composite sample from all habitats indicated increased richness at the landscape scale; gamma diversity was 28% higher on average than in the absence of beaver-modified habitat. Feeding guild composition shifted from grazer/scraper and filter feeder dominance in unmodified habitats to shredder and collector-gatherer dominance in beaver-created habitats. 5. Dam building by beaver in degraded environments can improve physical and biological diversity when viewed at a scale encompassing both modified and unmodified habitats. By restoring ecosystem processes locally, it may also offer wider scale benefits, including greater nutrient retention and flood attenuation. These benefits should be evaluated against evidence of any negative effects on land use or fisheries.},

journal = {Journal of Animal Ecology},
volume = {60},

pages = {79-91},
abstract = {(1) We surveyed the distribution of water voles (Arvicola terrestris) every month at thirty-nine sites on rivers in the North Yorkshire Moors National Park, for 2 years (1985 and 1986). Detailed studies continued at a small number of selected sites until 1989. Sites were sections of river bank 100-300 m long, the distance typically occupied by discrete breeding colonies of voles in this area. (2) In the main survey period (1985 and 1986) we found ten 'core sites' with breeding colonies of voles. A further fifteen sites were classified as 'peripheral' (visited by voles, but lacking breeding colonies). We found no evidence that water voles ever visited or used the remaining fourteen sites. (3) Data on bankside vegetation, bank angles, human disturbance, and grazing regimes by domestic stock were used in principal component analysis to classify habitat characteristics associated with core, peripheral and other sites. (4) Core sites were closely grouped in principal component space, and were characterized by a high percentage of grass, steep bank angles, and relatively high layering of the vegetation. These characteristics are readily interpreted in terms of water vole biology. (5) On the basis of habitat characteristics, we identified a further twelve unoccupied or peripheral sites that should have been suitable for breeding water voles. All these sites were more isolated and/or suffered much higher predation by mink (Mustela vison) than core sites. We also observed the extermination of two former core sites as mink invaded the area between 1987 and 1989. (6) We conclude that there are gaps in the distribution of the water vole because some habitats are unsuitable (approximately 45% of sites) and of sites with suitable habitat, about 30% lack water voles because they are too isolated (reducing colonization rates) and/or suffer very high levels of mink predation (increasing extinction rates). The conservation implications of these results are briefly discussed.},

In the first stage of this study we summarized information from published literature on the biology, habitat requirements, home range use and population densities of Wild Boar, and using a GIS we identified four suitable sites of significant size, all located in Highlands. In the second stage we used a Population Viability Analysis (RAMAS/age), parameterized with published information on survival and fecundity of European Wild Boar populations, to calculate the number of animals required in a 'release population' if it were to survive on average 50 years. At the two largest sites that we considered, a release population of 50 animals would be Likely to produce a viable population. The study concluded that biologically, the reintroduction of the Wild Boar is possible. However, a complementary study examining both the environmental and the potential wider ecological and socio-economic impacts of Wild Boar will be required before reintroduction is seriously considered.},

abstract = {In order to test how flexibly animals are able to behave when making trade-offs that involve assessing constantly changing risks, we examined whether wild Eastern grey squirrels showed flexibility of behavioral responses in the face of variation in 2 conflicting risks, cache pilferage, and predation. We established that cache pilferage risk decreased with distance from cover and was thus negatively correlated with long-term predation risk. We then measured changes in foraging and food-caching behavior in the face of changes in the risk of predation and food theft over a short time-scale. We found that, overall, squirrels move further away from the safety of cover when they cache, compared to when they forage, as predicted by pilferage risk. However, there was no effect of immediate pilferage or predation risk (i.e., the presence of potential predators or pilferers) on the distance from cover at which they cached, and only a slight increase in forage distance when predation risk increased. These results suggest that "rules of thumb" based on static cues may be more cost-effective for assessing risk than closely tracking changes over time in the way suggested by a number of models of risk assessment.},

abstract = {Understanding how local environmental factors lead to temporal variability of vital rates and to plasticity of life history tactics is one of the central questions in population ecology. We used long-term capture-recapture data from five populations of a small hibernating rodent, the edible dormouse Glis glis, collected over a large geographical range across Europe, to determine and analyze both seasonal patterns of local survival and their relation to reproductive activity. In all populations studied, survival was lowest in early summer, higher in late summer and highest during hibernation in winter. In reproductive years survival was always lower than in non-reproductive years, and females had higher survival rates than males. Very high survival rates during winter indicate that edible dormice rarely die from starvation due to insufficient energy reserves during the hibernation period. Increased mortality in early summer was most likely caused by high predation risk and unmet energy demands. Those effects have probably an even stronger impact in reproductive years, in which dormice were more active. Although these patterns could be found in all areas, there were also considerable differences in average survival rates, with resulting differences in mean lifetime reproductive success between populations. Our results suggest that edible dormice have adapted their life history strategies to maximize lifetime reproductive success depending on the area specific frequency of seeding events of trees producing energy-rich seeds.},

Rodents occurred more often in seats from grass dominant sites while gamebirds and lagomorphs were more frequent in seats from heather dominant sires.

In contrast, the occurrence of gamebirds in winter fox seats was unrelated to gamebird abundance but negatively related to rodent abundance.

abstract = {1. This review highlights the status of the European wild rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, which is threatened within its native range and yet is a highly successful colonizer across its worldwide, introduced range. 2. The European wild rabbit is a keystone species in Iberia, and the survival of a range of threatened predator species, including the Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus and Spanish imperial eagle Aquila aldabertii, is dependent upon the restoration of rabbit populations. Although not native to the UK, the rabbit also performs significant ecosystem services for nationally rare UK species, by maintaining short sward heights in heathland and grassland ecosystems, and serving as a prey item for populations of predators. 3. We identify the European wild rabbit as an excellent model to demonstrate the wide range of complex effects that an introduced mammalian species may exert on ecosystems to which it has been introduced. These effects include habitat degradation following overgrazing, competition with native mammals and facilitating meso-predator release and hyperpredation. 4. We also show that rabbit eradication from some sites may generate more problems than are solved because of the impacts of trophic cascades stemming from dependence on rabbits by native predator assemblages.},

abstract = {1. Climate is known to influence breeding phenology and reproductive success in temperate-zone bats, but long-term population level studies and interspecific comparisons are rare. 2. Investigating the extent to which intrinsic (i.e. age), and extrinsic (i.e. spring weather conditions), factors influence such key demographic parameters as the proportion of females becoming pregnant, or completing lactation, each breeding season, is vital to understanding of bat population ecology and life-history traits. 3. Using data from 12 breeding seasons (2006-2017), encompassing the reproductive histories of 623 Myotis daubentonii and 436 Myotis nattereri adult females, we compare rates of recruitment to the breeding population and show that these species differ in their relative sensitivity to environmental conditions and climatic variation, affecting annual reproductive success at the population level. 4. We demonstrate that (1) spring weather conditions influence breeding phenology, with warm, dry and calm conditions leading to earlier parturition dates and advanced juvenile development, whilst cold, wet and windy weather delays birth timing and juvenile growth; (2) reproductive rates in first-year females are influenced by spring weather conditions in that breeding season and in the preceding breeding season when each cohort was born. Pregnancy and lactation rates were both higher when favourable spring foraging conditions were more prevalent; (3)reproductive success increases with age in both species, but at different rates; (4) reproductive rates were consistently higher, and showed less interannual variation, in second-year and older M.daubentonii (mean 91.55% 0.05 SD) than M. nattereri (mean 72.74% +/- 0.15 SD); (5) estimates of reproductive success at the population level were highly correlated with the size of the juvenile cohort recorded each breeding season. 5. Improving understanding of the influence of environmental conditions, especially extreme climatic fluctuations, and the identification of critical periods (i.e. spring for reproductive female bats in temperate zones), which have disproportionate and lasting impacts on breeding phenology and reproductive success at a population level, is critical for improving predictions of the likely impact of climate change on bat populations.},

Five social groups, containing both males and females (each comprising 55-230 adult bats per annum, using 37-127 known roosts per colony), occupy discrete roosting areas to which individuals show high inter-annual fidelity. Natal philopatry is also high, compared to between colony movements, for both sexes in our study population. Despite considerable spatial overlap and variability in roost composition over the summer (April to October), related to temporal changes in reproductive status, there is sexual segregation within day roosts. Bachelor (adult male dominated) roosts are situated significantly further from water than maternity (adult female or juvenile dominated) roosts on average. This spatial partitioning between maternity and bachelor roosts operates within rather than between colony home roost ranges, however, with adult males from some social groups found roosting closer to water than are adult females from adjacent colonies. The co-occurrence of maternity and bachelor groups roosting in close proximity, including extensive spatial overlap in roosts occupied, and temporal overlap during roost sharing between the sexes, provides novel insights into social organisation and potential drivers of sexual segregation and mating strategies for this widespread and common species within lowland habitats.},

abstract = {Urbanization is a key global driver in the modification of land use and has been linked to population declines even in widespread and relatively common species. Cities comprise a complex assortment of habitat types yet we know relatively little about the effects of their composition and spatial configuration on species distribution. Although many bat species exploit human resources, the majority of species are negatively impacted by urbanization. Here, we use data from the National Bat Monitoring Programme, a long-running citizen science scheme, to assess how two cryptic European bat species respond to the urban landscape. A total of 124x1km(2) sites throughout Britain were surveyed. The landscape surrounding each site was mapped and classified into discrete biotope types (e.g., woodland). Generalized linear models were used to assess differences in the response to the urban environment between the two species, and which landscape factors were associated with the distributions of P.pipistrellus and P.pygmaeus. The relative prevalence of P.pygmaeus compared to P.pipistrellus was greater in urban landscapes with a higher density of rivers and lakes, whereas P.pipistrellus was frequently detected in landscapes comprising a high proportion of green space (e.g., parklands). Although P.pipistrellus is thought to be well adapted to the urban landscape, we found a strong negative response to urbanization at a relatively local scale (1km), whilst P.pygmaeus was detected more regularly in wooded urban landscapes containing freshwater. These results show differential habitat use at a landscape scale of two morphologically similar species, indicating that cryptic species may respond differently to anthropogenic disturbance. Even species considered relatively common and well adapted to the urban landscape may respond negatively to the built environment highlighting the future challenges involved in maintaining biodiversity within an increasingly urbanized world.},

abstract = {The rapid rate of urbanisation over the past century has occurred over a relatively small proportion of the earth's surface, yet it has had considerable ecological impact at a global scale. Urban waterways have historically been regarded as a disposable resource for human benefit which has had severe biological consequences. River rehabilitation schemes are attempting to address this; however restoration is frequently undertaken with minimal scientific input and fails to improve biodiversity. Many bat species are strongly associated with aquatic or adjacent riparian habitats but respond negatively to the built environment; however, we know little about the utilisation of urban waterways by bats. We therefore conducted a wide scale, multi-species study that examined how local habitat characteristics and the composition and heterogeneity of the surrounding landscape influence bat presence and activity along urban waterways. We recorded a total of 19,689 bat passes of seven species/genera from 30 urban waterways throughout the U.K. We show that the built environment can negatively affect a variety of species from the riparian zone up to 3 km from a waterway. Additionally, Myotis sp. activity was greater in waterways bounded by steep banksides and clear of invasive plant species. We also found differences in the response of two cryptic pipistrelle species to the built environment at multiple spatial scales indicating the difficulties of assessing how adaptable even morphologically similar species are to urbanisation. Beneficial urban waterway rehabilitation schemes for bats require management at multiple spatial scales. At a local scale, retaining a vegetated riparian zone, with a reduction in invasive aquatic plant species, is likely to benefit a variety of taxa. At a landscape scale, our results show, that the influence of the built environment can stretch a considerable distance highlighting the necessity for conservation funding to be spent on the implementation of landscape scale environmental improvement schemes which encompass the entire urban matrix.

journal = {Wildlife Research},
volume = {40},
number = {8},
pages = {675-684},
abstract = {Context. Determining the biodiversity of an area is essential for making targeted conservation decisions. Undertaking surveys to confirm species presence or to estimate population sizes can be difficult, particularly for elusive species. Bats are able to detect and avoid traps, making it difficult to quantify abundance. Although acoustic surveys using bat detectors are often used as a surrogate for relative abundance, the implicit assumption that there is a positive correlation between activity levels and abundance is rarely tested. Aims. We assessed the effectiveness of surveying techniques (i.e. trapping and acoustic monitoring) for detecting species presence and tested the strength of collinearity among methods. In addition, we tested whether the use of an acoustic lure (a bat-call synthesiser) increased bat-capture rate and therefore species detectability. Methods. Surveying was carried out over 3 years in central Scotland (UK), in 68 woodlands within predominantly agricultural or urban landscapes. Key results. There was a significant positive relationship between bat activity recorded on ultrasonic detectors and the relative abundance of Pipistrellus pygmaeus and P. pipistrellus, but not those in the genus Myotis. In general, acoustic monitoring was more effective than trapping at determining species presence; however, to ensure rarer or quiet species are recorded, a complementary approach is required. Broadcasting four different types of echolocation call resulted in a 2-12-fold increase in trapping success across four species of insectivorous bat found in the study region. Whereas lure effectiveness remained unchanged for female P. pygmaeus over time, there was a marked increase in the number of males captured using the lure throughout the summer (May to September). Conclusions. In the present study, we have demonstrated a variety of ways to increase surveying efficiency, which can maximise the knowledge of diversity in an area, minimise wildlife disturbance, and enhance surveying effectiveness. Implications. Increasing surveying efficiency can improve the accuracy of targeted conservation decisions.},

Deer (Cervidae) populations are managed worldwide due to their impacts on anthropocentric interests. In the UK, deer can only lawfully be shot during the daytime, from 1 h before sunrise to 1 h after sunset, when deer activity is at its lowest. We evaluated performance of a thermal imager relative to binoculars for their ability to detect deer during the daytime and at twilight (1 h either side of dawn and dusk). Transect surveys on Thorne Moors, UK, revealed that more roe and red deer were observed using a thermal imager than when using binoculars. More deer in much larger groups were observed at twilight than during the other daylight hours. Variation in animal detectability at different times of the day must be considered during wildlife surveys if their outputs are to be as accurate and precise as possible. The results support the continued focus of deer culling efforts during the hours of twilight. They also highlight the potential utility of thermal imagers for maximising detection probability at twilight.},

abstract = {The social organisation of a population of Microtus agrestis (Linnaeus, 1761) was studied by live trapping and radiotracking in southern England. Radiotracking revealed significant differences in both female home ranges and core areas with breeding condition. Lactating females had the smallest home ranges and core areas, and pregnant females the largest. There were no significant differences in female home range and core areas during the breeding season or between years despite different densities. Females were only territorial whilst lactating during which time their core areas were small. There were some overlaps of core areas among females at the beginning of the breeding season which are thought to be due to familiarity or kin associations. Associations between females were short-lived, lasting approximately one breeding event. As the breeding season progressed core areas became distinct suggesting a change to a territorial system although densities were low and most females were lactating. Patterns of social organisation among females were similar in both 1995 and 1996. Mean nearest neighbour distances tended to increase as the breeding season progressed and were uncorrelated with density.},

We studied Eurasian red squirrel, Sciurus vulgaris, dispersal patterns in a stable habitat with predictable food supply and a variable habitat with large temporal and spatial variations in food availability. In both habitats, we observed a male-biased immigration in spring and a female-biased immigration in autumn. However, there were more adults among immigrating red squirrels in the variable (66%) than the stable (31%) habitat and large differences in the extent of site fidelity between the two squirrel populations. Multivariate analyses indicate that food availability appeared to be the main factor affecting female dispersal behaviour. The data also suggest that female red squirrel dispersal patterns are an adaptive response to the predictability of food resources in space and time. Male dispersal behaviour seemed to be influenced by the distribution of the females. Their level of site fidelity was high in the stable habitat, whereas they appeared to track the movement of females in the variable habitat.

journal = {Journal of Zoology},

abstract = {Seasonal body weight changes were investigated in red and grey squirrels in spruce-dominated conifer plantations in the north of England. Annual seed food availability, particularly in the spruce plantations, varies markedly and is characterized by years with large cone crops ('mast crops') followed by several years of intermediate or low crops. The last mast crop in Kielder Forest District occurred in 1991 and we studied the two squirrel species when food availability was intermediate and low between 1992 and 1999. Neither red nor grey squirrels in the conifer plantations significantly increased their body weight for the autumn or winter. The responses of red and grey squirrels to the different foraging conditions in deciduous and conifer woodlands and the accumulation of seasonal fat stores may have to be seen in the context of habitat type and the pattern and predictability of seed availability. Our findings suggest that fat accumulation is likely to be less pronounced in conifer habitats where autumn and winter food supplies are more predictable, and manoeuvrability to feed on cones in the canopy is important.},

An intensive study of hares, rabbits and the dynamics of pastures over two grazing seasons was undertaken, in order to understand the environmental factors associated with hare and rabbit abundance at field level. Linear mixed models were used to assess the environmental variables, in terms of the structure, nutritional components and effects of livestock grazing that are associated with the abundance of the two species. The models revealed that hares were negatively associated with grazing intensity and plant diversity, whereas rabbits showed the strongest associations with nutritional content of pastures, in particular fat, nitrogen and fibre content in forage, as well as a positive association with short grass swards. The data suggest that, at the field-scale intensification of pasture use may have contributed to declines in hares and increases in rabbits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Coexistence of ecologically similar species is sustained by niche partitioning, a fundamental element of which is diet. Overlapping of resource requirements between sympatric species can create interspecific competitive or facilitative effects on the foraging behaviour of herbivores. Brown hares (Lepus europaeus) and European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are similar in size, morphology, feeding type and occupy the same habitats, but direct evidence of competition for resources between them is lacking. Both species are widespread and simultaneously pests and species of conservation concern in different parts of their range. We investigated dietary overlap of brown hares and European rabbits in pastures in relation to pasture management and hare and rabbit abundance. Grasses were the predominant component in both hare and rabbit diets with high overlap of plant species. Both rabbits and hares showed some selectivity for particular plants with evidence of consistent selection for Phleum spp. and relative avoidance of Poa spp. However, differences in the smaller components of hare and rabbit diet resulted in significant differences in diet overall. There was no evidence that higher relative density of one species led to dietary shifts but pasture management affected the diet of both species. Nutritional composition of diets of both species also differed between cattle and sheep pastures with higher fibre, ash and fat in the former. Our data provide no evidence of competitive exclusion between rabbits and hares on the basis of diet, but suggest that the effects of livestock on their respective diets may influence indirect competition in favour of rabbits over hares.},

There was some evidence that following a positive test for Babesia badgers were more likely to be caught again in subsequent years when compared to individuals testing negative.

At badger setts, once it was clear that the encounter was not going to escalate to aggression, each species was unaffected by the presence, proximity or orientation of the other. There are preliminary indications that foxes sometimes seek the company of badgers.},

The hypothesis that this increase is either the consequence of improved badger protection or of changes in habitat can be rejected for this site. Instead, a link between increasing numbers and changing weather patterns, possibly resulting from climate change, is investigated. In particular, attention is drawn to a correlation between mild winters and heavier body weights of badgers in January. Furthermore socio-spatial restructuring within the population may be the mechanism that has permitted high density to be sustainable. The increase in badger numbers at Wytham has not affected population sex ratio, which has remained relatively constant at parity throughout the study.},

abstract = {Weather conditions, and how they in turn define and characterize regional climatic conditions, are a primary limit on global species diversity and distribution, and increasing variability in global and regional climates have significant implications for species and habitat conservation. A Capture-Mark-Recapture study revealed that badger (Meles meles) life history parameters interact in complicated ways with annual variability in the seasonality of temperature and rainfall, both in absolute and in phenological terms. A strong predictive relationship was observed between survival and both temperature and late-summer rainfall. This link at the population dynamics level was related to individual body-weight increases observed between summer and autumn. In addition, fecundity was correlated with spring rainfall and temperature. We investigated and confirmed that relationships were consistent with observed variation in the intensity of a parasitic infection. Finally, fecundity during any given year correlated with conditions in the preceding autumn. Badger survival also correlated with late winter weather conditions. This period is critical for badgers insofar as it coincides with their peak involvement in road traffic accidents (RTAs). RTA rate during this period was linked strongly to temperature, underlining the intricate ways in which a changing climate might interact with anthropogenic agents to influence species' population processes. Equinoctial conditions produced significant population driver effects. That is, while summers will always be relatively warm compared with winters, spring and autumn weather can be more variable and functionally delimit the 'productive' vs. nonproductive period of the year in terms of badger behavioural and physiological cycles. This study highlights how appropriately informed conservation strategies, mindful of trends in climatic conditions, will become ever-more essential to ensure the survival of many species globally.},

abstract = {Are setts significant determinants of badger socio-spatial organisation, and do suitable sett sites represent a limited resource, potentially affecting badger distributions? The factors determining diurnal resting den, or sett, location and selection by Eurasian badgers Meles meles L. were investigated in Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire. 279 sett sites were located. The habitat parameters that were associated with the siting of these setts were analysed and associations were sought between sett location and character and the body condition and body weight of resident badgers Habitat characteristics in the vicinity of setts were significantly different from randomly selected points. Badgers preferentially selected sites with sandy, well-drained soils, situated on NW-facing, convex and moderately inclined slopes at moderate altitude. There was no evidence that sett morphology (number of entrances, sett area, number of hinterland latrines) was affected by the surrounding sett site habitat characteristics. Mean body weight was significantly higher for badgers occupying territories with setts in sandy soils, situated on NW-facing slopes, than in territories with less optimal sett characteristics. Contrary to the hypothesis that the availability of sett sites was limiting, and therefore that sett dispersion dictates the spatial and social organisation of their populations, the badgers were clearly able to excavate new setts. On our measures, these new setts were not inferior to old established ones, despite occupying subsequently exploited sites; the badgers utilising these new setts had neither lighter body weights nor poorer body condition scores. During the period of our study badgers have manifestly been able to dig numerous new setts; as satisfactory sites still remain available, this indicates that suitable sett sites have not yet become a limiting resource. There was no relationship between sett age and the characteristics of the site in which it was dug, as suitable sites were not limiting. Significantly, population expansion during the decade 1987-1997 was not constrained by lack of setts, rather the main proliferation in setts occurred after the population size had peaked in 1996. Some implications for the management and conservation of the Eurasian badger are considered.},

abstract = {Based on 15 years of observations of a badger (Meles meles) population at Wytham Woods in the central United Kingdom, we investigated which parameters governed demographic changes, using data recording the life histories of 868 individuals. We modeled the population in terms of a stage-classified matrix, giving an exponential population growth rate of r = 0.063 (lambda = 1.065). Population elasticity values, derived from this matrix, produced a relative order of importance of regulatory parameters governing this population growth rate, of: adult survival (P-a) > fertility (F) > juvenile survival (P-j) > age at 1st reproduction (alpha) > age at last reproduction (omega). Thus, changes in P-a and F have the greatest potential to influence population growth rate. The population underwent a dramatic change in the last 5 years of the study, with a decline, then stabilization in population growth. However, this change was not related to any change in elasticity patterns between the 2 periods. Comparing the latter period to the preceding period of marked population growth revealed that fertility rate had little actual influence, whereas adult and juvenile survival rates were far more influential demographic variables. These findings prompted a 2nd, retrospective, analytical approach, a life-table response experiment (LTRE), revealing that the importance of P-j in the LTRE contrasted with its lesser prospective importance in the elasticity analysis. Change in fertility (Delta F) apparently had little environmental or genetic scope (according to the results of either technique) to influence regulation in this population. We also tested for delayed density dependence using the theta logistic model. Because territorial animals are expected to respond quickly to the effects of density dependence, corresponding to theta < 1, our rejection of this hypothesis indicated that the restrictions of territorial sociospatial regulation are relaxed in this badger population. These results are used to highlight population vulnerabilities.},

Phase 1 used GIS to investigate the wider availability of habitat for beavers in Scotland, and predicted that there is the capacity to support in the order of 180 to 390 beaver families. Phase 2 involved the preliminary assessment of nine sites using brief field surveys. Phase 3 focused further on the three most suitable sites, where a thorough habitat survey was used as a basis for calculating carrying capacities of between three and five families. Finally, phase 4 used population modelling to assess the viability and likely spread of beavers following release at these three best sites. High, medium and low parameters were derived from the literature, and populations were predicted to persist and spread as long as at least the medium parameters were used. This exercise illustrates the power of combining field surveys and GIS-based population modelling as a tool for planning reintroductions in general, and as a foundation for planning the reintroduction of beavers in particular.},

journal = {Mammal Review},
volume = {37},

abstract = {1The impacts of agricultural intensification on farmland wildlife have been the subject of increasing concern, particularly over the last two decades. Population declines have occurred for a number of mammalian species, sometimes drastically so, and changes in farming practice are believed to be significant contributory factors. 2The major policy instruments for delivering environmental benefits on farmland are agri-environment schemes. These encourage farmers to adopt more environmentally sensitive farming practices to promote farmland biodiversity. Additionally, compulsory set-aside, which reduces agricultural surplus, could also have positive impacts on wildlife. In this paper we consider some of the putative benefits of agri-environment schemes and set-aside for mammals. 3We review how establishment and management options within agri-environment schemes and set-aside might affect habitat resources for mammals. For example, conservation headlands increase plant and invertebrate resources within the crop edge for mammals such as wood mice. Grassy field margins can support communities of smaller mammals, and hedgerows may act as important commuting and hunting routes. Their potential will depend on factors such as seed mixtures used, timing and severity of cutting, and length of time they have been in place. 4At a farm level, habitat heterogeneity may be increased through organic agriculture, which is supported by some agri-environment schemes. Studies suggest significant benefits to mammals, including wood mice and bats. However, it is increasingly recognized that effective conservation of farmland mammals must seek solutions at the landscape scale, addressing such issues as habitat connectivity between farms. One approach may be the better targeting of scheme agreements. 5We suggest that agri-environment schemes and set-aside can contribute to the conservation of mammals on farmland. Recent policy changes are likely to have further positive impacts on farmland wildlife but appropriate mammal monitoring programmes must be developed rigorously to assess their effects.},

We also investigated the effect of habitat (field centre vs edge), and of season and year. This was done at the individual level using radio-tracking, and at the population level using live-trapping. Wood mouse population size (estimated as minimum number alive) was significantly affected by season. Wood mouse numbers also differed between crop types. Rape field centres and edges had significantly lower numbers than did barley or wheat field centres and edges. Populations were largest from April to July, when the crop was tall. In winter, significantly more mice were found in field edges compared with field centres. The patterns of movement of individual mice also showed differences between habitats and between seasons. Mice were found to move more quickly when they were tracked through rape compared with the other crops. When the crop was growing, they moved faster through field edges bordered with hedgerow than they did through wood. This pattern was reversed later in the year when the crop was tall. The distances moved during a session of tracking showed differences which paralleled those for speed of movement. Also, males tended to move faster than females. Differences between the sexes in movement patterns were affected by season; when the crop was down (in winter) females moved further than males during a session of tracking, but when the crop was growing and tall, this was reversed.},

abstract = {Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been criticized for being inadequately monitored and for not delivering the expected benefits to nature. Consequently, the Welsh Government funded a comprehensive programme of monitoring of AES between 2009 and 2012. The AES assessment focused on Tir Gofal (which translates as Land in Care) but also included the Organic Farming Scheme, and monitoring focused on a range of taxa of conservation importance: arable plants, grassland fungi, bats (six species), butterflies (three species), birds (five species), water vole and brown hare. Field surveys were carried out on matched farms and fields within and outside of AES. Response variables were spatial trends of abundance, occurrence and species richness, and were modelled against AES status. Existing data were also available for two bird species. Few differences were observed between AES and non-AES farms and fields. Those that were observed were for species that use arable habitats (which are uncommon in Wales): arable plants, yellowhammers and brown hares. The lack of differences in non-arable habitats may reflect the smaller contrast between AES and non-AES management in these habitats. It may also reflect the original condition of habitat entered into AES prescriptions, as most non-arable prescriptions were defined by mandatory management of existing habitats, rather than optional habitat creation or restoration, which is the case for most arable prescriptions. Despite the lack of differences observed, AES may help to maintain populations of species, making it more likely that they will persist in the landscape. There is evidence, from this monitoring programme and elsewhere, that AES can increase the populations of species, when well targeted and implemented.Policy implications. Our results indicate that Welsh Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been only partly successful in achieving their stated aim of maintaining and enhancing species abundance. They can be used to improve AES design and management, both in Wales and more widely, by identifying and promoting effective management interventions, and by identifying ineffective management interventions and seeking alternatives. Comprehensive monitoring of AES, combined with specific targets regarding expected outcomes, is essential to determine whether AES are providing value for money.},

abstract = {Many temperate zone bat species form colonies during the highly synchronised summer breeding period allowing differences in foraging behaviour to be compared between females in different reproductive states. Such comparisons may clarify mechanisms of population regulation. Individual female (n = 20) noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) from the same colony, but in different reproductive states (lactating or non-lactating), were radio-tracked and their use of foraging space, in relation to available habitat types, assessed and compared. Habitat preference was determined using compositional analysis on two levels: overall preference within the minimum convex polygon (MCP) used by the colony (total area 62.75 km(2)) and overall preference within individual bat MCPs (mean area 8.2 km(2)). A further comparison of relative habitat use, between lactating and non-lactating bats, demonstrated state-dependent differences in use and identified habitats important for foraging in reproducing bats. Broadleaved woodland and pasture were the highest ranked foraging habitats consistently preferred by noctule bats across both levels. Although there was little difference in foraging activity (e.g. nightly duration, median 115 min) or maximum distances travelled to foraging grounds (mean 4.23 km), non-lactating bats used less preferred marginal habitats (arable land and moorland) significantly more than lactating bats. The observed spatial partitioning is discussed in relation to density dependence and the conservation implications of changing land use for bat populations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. Recent characterizations of the spatial scale of population dynamics have typically considered patterns at a single scale and ignored the possibility that different patterns may arise at different scales. In this study we assessed population densities of field voles with cyclic dynamics in northern England at 147 sites from three spatial scales on five occasions over a 2.5-year period. 2. The scale over which densities were similar was estimated by comparing the variance of density at the three scales (< 1 km(2), 10 km(2), and 70 km(2)) and by using autocorrelation techniques. Closer sites were more similar in density than more distant sites and the autocorrelations suggested that sites up to within 8-20 km had more similar densities and higher population synchrony than the average similarity for all the sampling sites. 3, A generalized additive model fitted to all the data showed that the data supported the hypothesis of a travelling wave of vole densities moving through the study area. The model assumed that the wave moved at a constant speed and in a uniform direction. Estimates of the wave's speed (14 km year(-1)) and direction (travelling in a direction of 66<degrees> from north) were consistent with the estimates which had previously been calculated from a time series of vole densities covering a much smaller spatial area but a longer temporal scale. 4. The spatio-temporal pattern of vole densities detected over a small spatial scale therefore appears to extend over much larger scales and occurs despite the fragmentation of suitable vole habitat at local (a few square kilometres) and regional (hundreds of square kilometres) scales.},

In England much small mammal habitat occurs in suburban and rural areas where the majority of roads are either single track or two lanes, and traffic density is light. This study investigated the effect of minor roads on the movements of two small mammals, the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Capture-Mark-Recapture was used to study movements beside and across rural roads of two different widths. The results suggest that even small roads less than 6metres wide, with relatively little traffic, do act as partial barriers for these small mammals, reducing their movement between habitats on either side of the road. It is evident that island populations are being created as a result of road construction, even access roads within nature reserves.},

abstract = {Effective conservation management for species that function as metapopulations requires an understanding of population dynamics at the landscape scale. The water vole, Arvicola amphibius, is one such species. Water voles have recently undergone a significant decline in the UK, as a result of habitat loss and predation from the introduced American mink, Neovison vison. Large reed bed and grazing marsh sites can provide refuge habitats for water voles from mink predation, in which case populations within these sites could sustain metapopulations in the surrounding landscape where conditions are less favourable. We carried out a study using a stochastic patch occupancy model to determine the long term viability of water vole metapopulations in the wider landscape around a series of extensive reed bed and grazing marsh sites designated as National Key Sites for water voles. The results of our model simulations show that a large protected core site, or mainland, is essential in maintaining the long term viability of these systems. Our results also show how these metapopulations could be enhanced by increasing patch numbers through habitat creation and/or restoration and suggest what the minimum effective size of created or restored patches should be. The study shows how population modelling can provide insight into some effective practical ways of enhancing the viability of water vole metapopulations at the landscape scale. Furthermore it demonstrates that extensive wetlands are an appropriate focus for water vole conservation measures.},

abstract = {The Channel Island of Jersey is 116 km(2) but has only 540 ha of woodland distributed in 237 wooded fragments with mean size of 2.5 ha. Despite this, the island supports 300 to 600 red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris, a species that is under threat in mainland Britain from habitat fragmentation, disease and the spread of the alien grey squirrel S. carolinensis. Grey squirrels are not present on Jersey. Between 1994 and 1997, using trapping and tracking techniques, we studied how red squirrels survive on Jersey by focusing on three local populations in sites B, C and S with contrasting food availability. The primary squirrel foods at site B were autumn tree seeds, at site C autumn tree seeds and summer conifer cones, and at site S autumn tree seeds and ad libitum, year-round supplementary food provided by local people. The densities of squirrels in site C (mean over 3 years 0.97 ha(-1)) and site S (1.21 ha (1)) were more than one and a half times that of site B (0.68 ha(-1)), which relied on autumn seeds. Body mass and condition, and early breeding (spring litters) were not affected by food availability although conception occurred as early as November, earlier than in mainland Britain. Less than 50%, of females produced summer litters, and 88% of non-breeders did not receive supplementary food. Turnover rates were lowest and most stable in site B. Annual residency was not influenced by the size of the natural tree seed crop. Cat and road kills caused two out of three reported deaths. This island population seems to remain viable as a result of an extended breeding season and increased population densities in sites with summer or supplementary food. The results emphasize the beneficial effects of extra food provided by local people. This provides a buffering effect against variations in natural food availability, and seems to be important for their long-term survival.},

abstract = {A maternity colony of pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), in Oxfordshire, was monitored between 1 March 1989 and 6 October 1989. An infra-red' automatic bat counter was installed at the roost, to record the number of bats entering and leaving each minute throughout the night. Air temperature, light intensity at sunset, cloud cover, wind speed and rain were recorded on each night of monitoring. Insect abundance was estimated on 18 nights. The nightly activity pattern was found to be unimodal in pregnancy, bimodal during lactation and unimodal post-weaning. The mean time that each bat spent outside the roost ranged from 103-483 min, with a mean of 321 min. Ambient air temperature and length of night were significant factors affecting mean time spent outside the roost. The percentage of the night which the bats spent away from the roost ranged from 22 to 88%, with a mean of 64%. There was a significant positive correlation between ambient air temperature and percentage of the night spent away from the roost. Insect abundance showed no significant correlation with the time that bats spent outside the roost. Wind and rain had no apparent effect on time spent outside the roost.},

abstract = {The Mammal Society has co-ordinated a population survey of Wood Mice Apodemus sylvaticus and Bank Voles Clethrionomys glareolus in 13 0.81 -hectare sites in Britain. Numbers of mice and voles live-trapped using standard methods were collated every May/June and November/December from 1982 to 1987. The data were analysed with results from four independent studies in England and the corresponding assessments of tree seed crop size. Wood Mouse numbers are usually higher in winter than in summer but Bank Vole fluctuations are less regular. In deciduous woodland, Wood Mouse mean relative densities are significantly greater in the winter and the following summer after a good seed crop than after a poor one; rates of population change from summer to winter are significantly higher when a good seed crop falls. Bank Vole relative densities are significantly greater in the summer following a good seed crop than after a poor one, and rates of change from winter to summer are significantly higher. In Wood Mouse populations, tests for density dependence suggest that it is strong from summer to winter but absent from winter to summer; in Bank Voles weaker density dependence is present in both halves of the year. Thus, Wood Mouse numbers are regulated in autumn but are also influenced by seed crop size in winter and the following summer; Bank Vole numbers are less strongly regulated during both autumn and spring and are influenced by seed crop size in the following summer. Evidence is presented suggesting that populations of each species in deciduous woodlands are synchronized over the country in summer and that Wood Mice are also synchronized in winter; highs and lows tend to coincide between different sites. The yield of tree seed is shown to vary significantly from year to year and may be the cause of the synchrony, but weather effects may also be involved.},

abstract = {Invasive plants can have dramatic effects on natural ecosystems. It is unclear, though, whether these will have a positive or negative effect on animal species' behavior and population parameters within ecosystems where invasive plants occur. Here, we use a 2-year time series of mouse trapping data to test the effects of an evergreen invasive shrub, Rhododendron ponticum, on population distribution and abundance in a population of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in southern England. Given the importance of aerial predators on rodent survival and the shield that the thick cover of Rhododendron branches and leaves provides, we predicted that Rhododendron would have a positive effect on mouse aggregation and abundance. The results confirmed both predictions: proximity to Rhododendron positively influenced mouse abundance, whereas a significant interaction between protective microhabitat features (logs) and Rhododendron suggest that reductions in predation risk drive the proximity results. In addition, as mouse densities increased, competition increased. During spring, when mouse territoriality was greatest, we found primarily large adults in the Rhododendron habitat, with subadult and juvenile mice more likely to be found away from Rhododendron patches. The effects of Rhododendron-driven increases in mouse density on lower (seed predation and dispersal) and upper trophic level (weasel populations) are also discussed. Questing tick's density and invertebrate biomass were also lower under Rhododendron. Our research shows that an invasive plant species can increase the abundance of a native mammal and that this could potentially lead to increases/decreases in other species populations within the community.},

abstract = {1. Accurate and precise estimates of abundance are required for the development of management regimes for deer populations. In woodland areas, indirect dung count methods, such as the clearance plot and standing crop methods, are currently the preferred procedures to estimate deer abundance. The use of line transect methodology is likely to provide a cost-effective alternative to these methods. 2. We outline a methodology based on line transect surveys of deer dung that can be used to obtain deer abundance estimates by geographical block and habitat type. Variance estimation procedures are also described. 3. As an example, we applied the method to estimate sika deer Cervus nippon abundance in south Scotland. Estimates of deer defecation and length of time to dung decay were used to convert pellet group density to deer density by geographical block and habitat type. The results obtained agreed with knowledge from cull and sightings data, and the precision of the estimates was generally high. 4. Relatively high sika deer densities observed in moorland areas up to 300 m from the forest edge indicated the need to encompass those areas in future surveys to avoid an underestimate of deer abundance in the region of interest. 5. It is unlikely that a single method for estimating deer abundance will prove to be better under all circumstances. Direct comparisons between methods are required to evaluate thoroughly the relative merits of each of them. 6. Line transect surveys of dung are becoming a widely used tool to aid management and conservation of a wide range of species. The survey methodology we outline is readily adaptable to other vertebrates that are amenable to dung survey methodology.},

We conducted autumn and spring live-trapping studies of A. flavicollis and A. sylvaticus, using standardised transect lines to calculate relative abundance indices for 19 woodlands ranging in size from 2.2 to 113.5 ha in Gloucestershire, south-west England. Habitat features were measured for each woodland. Different habitat structures within woodlands affected the abundance of each Apodemus species. Canopy cover, the number of hard seed/fruit tree species and fallen timber were important variables affecting the abundance of A. flavicollis, while herbaceous cover and height influenced the abundance of A. sylvaticus. Woodland size and recent/ancient age classifications were not good predictors of A. flavicollis abundance. The abundance of A. flavicollis was highest in mature woodlands. Many common woodland conservation management practices may positively affect the local abundance of A. flavicollis in areas within its natural distribution. We suggest that current woodland management practices designed to conserve more immediately threatened species will also benefit A.flavicollis, especially in marginal areas of its range in Britain.

Litters of A. flavicollis were uncommon in nest boxes suggesting these boxes were rarely used for breeding. It seems likely that nest boxes form temporary nesting places for individuals, pairs or small communal groups. A. flavicollis sometimes take over nest boxes occupied by M. avellanarius, usually constructing their own nests and sometimes removing old nest material. M. avellanarius may avoid nest boxes occupied by A. flavicollis earlier in the same year. Boxes favoured by M. avellanarius in one year tended to be reselected by them in the following year, but no such trend was apparent in box selection by A. flavicollis. Overall, there was little evidence to suggest that the presence of A. flavicollis had a significant impact on M. avellanarius occupancy of nest boxes.},

abstract = {A national survey of the Yellow-necked Mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) in Britain was undertaken by The Mammal Society. The live-trapping study sampled small mammal populations from 168 deciduous woodlands in autumn 1998. Within their range, Yellow-necked Mice were widespread in deciduous woodland and were more abundant than Wood Mice in 15% of the woodlands sampled. These trapping records, as well as records solicited from local recorders, record centres and individuals, supplemented the existing distribution map, confirming the general pattern, but with minor extensions to some range borders. Yellow-necked Mice were found in woodland of all ages, but were more common in woods of ancient origin than in younger woodland. Woodland size was not important in determining the presence or abundance of Yellow-necked Mice, but they were more often absent from woods more than 2 km from neighbouring substantial woodland. The presence of Yellow-necked Mice did not affect the relative abundance of Wood Mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). However, the decline in the proportion of breeding male Wood Mice at the end of the main breeding season was more marked in those woods that also contained Yellow-necked Mice. Where their ranges overlapped, Bank Voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) were less abundant where Yellow-necked Mice were also present. The distribution of the Yellow-necked Mouse was explored with respect to a number of climatic, soil and habitat variables. Maximum summer temperature was the most significant variable explaining distribution, although woodland cover variables also contributed. Soil moisture and pH, mean rainfall and winter temperature parameters did not predict Yellow-necked Mouse distribution. Low summer temperature may limit Yellow-necked Mouse distribution through its impact on tree seed production and diversity. Climatic change leading to a rise in summer temperature might encourage range expansion by Yellow-necked Mice, if their other habitat requirements are met.},

abstract = {It is becoming increasingly evident that the social behaviour of many group-living species is more complex than previously assumed and that free mixing of individuals, even within social groups, is rare. This has important implications for ecological processes, such as disease transmission, which are dependent on interactions between individuals. European wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been considered traditionally as highly sociable animals that mix freely within groups but interact less frequently between groups. We deployed proximity logging devices to quantify the intra- and inter-group contact behaviour of free-living wild rabbits in two populations in a temperate region of Australia. Altogether, 126 rabbits were fitted with proximity loggers at least once during the study. Radio-tracking was carried out alongside proximity data collection to determine the space use of rabbit social groups within the study sites. On average, a rabbit made only 1.54 +/- 0.23 (SE) (median = 0.54) contacts per day with each other rabbit carrying a proximity logger in its social group, and the mean daily contact duration was 202 +/- 38 s/day (SE) (median = 29 s). Despite the high degree of home range overlap between the neighbouring social groups, inter-group contacts were highly infrequent and brief. Our results demonstrated considerable spatial and temporal heterogeneities in the contact behaviour between individual rabbits, both between populations and between and within social groups in the same population. Such variations in the social organisation of rabbits are likely to create complex patterns of disease transmission through direct contact and may contribute towards observed heterogeneities in the effects of disease on wild rabbit populations.},

abstract = {European otters declined dramatically from the 1950s, disappearing from many rivers. We report here on long-term monitoring (from 1977) in 3 catchments in western Britain that were recolonized naturally and in 2 catchments in eastern England that were reinforced by captive-bred otters. A minimum of 16-years data was collected on each river until 2002. At a series of sites in each study river, the percentages which were positive for otters and the number of spraints per sprainting Site were recorded and combined to produce an annual index of population. One western river, naturally recolonized, showed rapid early population growth for 5 years, followed by slower growth, while growth was steadier in 2 catchments which already held some otters at the beginning of the study. Colonization on the eastern rivers was slower, with greater fluctuations over time. Annual population growth rates were estimated at 1-7%, higher in the earlier years. A strategy for annual monitoring of otters is recommended.},

abstract = {Context. Fertility control appears as a publicly acceptable alternative to lethal methods for limiting population growth in wildlife. Recently developed single-dose immunocontraceptive vaccines have induced infertility in several mammals. However, the potential side-effects and the long-term effectiveness of these contraceptives have been poorly investigated. Aims. We tested the long-term effectiveness and potential side-effects of the single-dose gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine GonaCon (TM) on captive female wild boar. Methods. We carried out two sequential trials: Trial 1 (n = 6 GonaCon (TM)-treated and 6 control wild boar) and Trial 2 which started two years later and replicated Trial 1. We assessed the effectiveness of GonaCon (TM) to cause infertility by measuring GnRH antibody titres, by monitoring the oestrous cycle through the concentration of faecal progesterone and by recording the sows' reproductive output in the 4-6 years following treatment. We evaluated the potential side-effects by monitoring behaviour, bodyweight and haematological and biochemical variables. Key results. GnRH-antibody titres decreased with time but were still detectable in all females six years after vaccination with a single dose of GonaCon (TM). In Trial 1 none of the treated females gave birth in the six years after vaccination. In Trial 2, progesterone indicated that two of the six treated females were cycling. One of the cycling treated females gave birth one year after vaccination; the other five, including the second cycling sow, did not reproduce in the four years following vaccination. We found no differences in bodyweight, haematology, biochemistry and behaviour and no obvious sign of injection site reaction. Conclusions. GonaCon (TM) can suppress reproduction in wild boar with no long-term effects on behaviour and physiology. Therefore, GonaCon (TM) can be regarded as an effective and safe contraceptive for this species. Implications. The lack of evidence of adverse effects and the longevity of effect of GonaCon (TM) suggest that this contraceptive could be now tested in field trials and in contexts where culling of overabundant populations of wild boar is unfeasible, illegal or unacceptable. These instances include urban areas, parks, and management of diseases where culling might cause social perturbation and result in increased disease transmission rates.},

abstract = {Fertility control has the potential to be used as an attractive alternative to lethal methods for limiting population growth in overabundant species. This study tested the effectiveness and potential side effects of the single-dose gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine GonaCon on the physiology and behaviour of two groups of captive female wild boar in two sequential trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2). Following vaccination with GonaCon, data on contraceptive effectiveness were recorded as well as data on time budget, social rank, bodyweight, haematology and biochemistry. The concentration of GnRH-antibody titres peaked 2 - 6 weeks after vaccination and remained relatively high 12 weeks after vaccination. In Trial 1, all control females and none of the treated females gave birth. In Trial 2, faecal progesterone of treated females decreased to basal levels within a month of vaccination. No differences in time budget, social rank and blood parameters were observed between treated and control females. Bodyweight increased more in treated females than in controls. These results indicated that GonaCon can suppress reproduction of wild boar with no significant short-term effects on behaviour and physiology. GonaCon can be regarded as an effective, humane and safe contraceptive for managing wild boar populations.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that drive species population dynamics is fundamental to biology. Cyclic populations of microtine rodents have been the most intensively studied to date, yet there remains great uncertainty over the mechanisms determining the dynamics of most of these populations. For one such population, we present preliminary evidence for a novel mechanism by which herbivore-induced reductions in plant quality alter herbivore life-history parameters and subsequent population growth. We tested the effect of high silica levels on the population growth and individual performance of voles (Microtus agrestis) reared on their winter food plant (Deschampsia caespitosa). In sites where the vole population density was high, silica levels in D. caespitosa leaves collected several months later were also high and vole populations subsequently declined; in sites where the vole densities were low, levels of silica were low and population density increased. High silica levels in their food reduced vole body mass by 0.5% a day. We argue that silica-based defences in grasses may play a key role in driving vole population cycles.},

pages = {153-167},
abstract = {Information on the status of biodiversity is crucial for species conservation and management. Large scale assessments are only feasible through citizen science but some taxa are poorly monitored because few people specialise in them. We explore alleviating this problem by using data collected for poorly monitored species as an add-on to existing bird surveys. Since 1995, participants in the annual Breeding Bird Survey have recorded the abundance of mammals during their surveys. We demonstrate the value of these data by developing spatial models of relative abundance for nine common and easily detected mammal species. Rabbit, brown hare and mountain hare all showed widespread declines. Conversely, deer showed increases throughout their ranges, with the exception of the red deer whose population was predominantly stable. The grey squirrel continues to increase in several areas. The red fox, the only carnivore with enough data, showed significant large declines. The collection of data on taxa other than the primary target has particular merit where the secondary taxa can be detected effectively by methods devised for the core survey. In such cases the data are inexpensive and inherit some of the benefits of the underlying structure and power of the core survey. However, the efficacy of the primary study design may vary for the members of secondary taxa and may not be temporally or spatially suitable for all of them. Although more volunteer training may be required, there are also opportunities to engage and enthuse people about conservation issues of other species groups.},

Cow- and badger-based control strategies have failed to eradicate bTB from the British cattle herd, and the incidence is rising by about 18% per year. The annual cost to taxpayers in Britain is currently k74 million. Research has focused on the badger as a potential bTB reservoir, with little attention being paid to other mammals common on farmland. We have conducted a systematic survey of wild mammals (n=4393 individuals) present on dairy farms to explore the role of species other than badgers in the epidemiology of bTB. Cultures were prepared from 10 397 samples (primarily faeces, urine and tracheal aspirates). One of the 1307 bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) live-sampled, and three of the 43 badgers (Meles meles), yielded positive isolates of Mycobacterium bovis. This is the first time the bacterium has been isolated from the bank vole. The strain type was the same as that found in cattle and badgers on the same farm. However, our work indicates that the mean prevalence of infectious individuals among common farmland wildlife is extremely low (the upper 95% confidence interval is <= 2.0 for all of the abundant species). Mathematical models illustrate that it is highly unlikely the disease could be maintained at such low levels. Our results suggest that these animals are relatively unimportant as reservoirs of bTB, having insufficient within-species (or within-group) transmission to sustain the infection, though occasional spill-overs from cattle or badgers may occur.},

The most frequent prey from all sites were ruffe, which were found in 69% of spraints. Eel Anguilla anguilla, cyprinids (roach Rutilus rutilus, dace Leuciscus leuciscus and minnow Phoxinus phoxinus) and Salmo spp. were also relatively common and were recovered in 60%, 35% and 33% of spraints, respectively. Northern pike Esox lucius (14%), perch Perca fluviatilis (12%), stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus (9%), powan Coregonus lavaretus (14%) and lampreys Lampetra spp. (2%) were less common. The fact that ruffe were the most frequent prey in otter spraints in all regions and in all seasons of the year indicated that they are one of the most important prey for otters in Loch Lomond at the present time.},

abstract = {The microclimate of the field vole (Microtus agrestis) was measured in rough grassland in SW Scotland from February-April 1992. Measurements represented conditions experienced by voles when foraging. Air temperature in the grass tunnels used by voles was only 0.3degreesC greater than air temperature above the vegetation. On average, the change in temperature in grass tunnels and at feeding stations used by voles matched the diurnal increase in air temperature. However, snow cover was found to insulate vole habitat from large changes in air temperature. The grassland provided considerable shading from solar radiation and shelter from Wind. Solar radiation and wind speed at the surface were closely coupled with conditions above the ground surface due to the short height of grassland at this season of the year. Although the winter temperatures experienced by field voles are well below their thermoneutral zone of metabolism, their sheltered microclimate means that they can remain active in wet and windy weather when predators may be less able to detect them.

abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bovine TB) is the most economically important animal health policy issue in Britain. The problem of what to do about badgers has plagued successive governments since a dead badger was discovered with bovine TB in 1971. Successive Labour governments (1997-2010) oversaw the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) from 1998 to 2006. Despite the RBCT recommendation against culling, the 2010-2015 Coalition government implemented pilot badger culls. This paper provides an account of the evolution of bovine TB and badger control policy, focusing on the 1997-2010 Labour, the 2010-2015 Coalition and the 2015-present Conservative governments. Interviews with bovine TB policy stakeholders supplement discussion of the development of bovine TB policy. The paper discusses the science and politics of bovine TB policy, in which there are different badger control policies in Westminster, Welsh and Scottish governments. Badger control is a highly polarised issue, and the Coalition and Conservative governments have been heavily criticised for a culling policy opposed by the independent scientific community. Recent governments have defended badger culling on the basis of veterinary advice and experience in countries such as New Zealand. The paper concludes with two key recommendations to inform controversial animal health and welfare policy issues such as bovine TB. First, mandatory Animal Welfare Impact Assessment provides objective data on the impacts of policy options on cows and badgers. Second, robust ethical analysis, conducted by independent experts using established moral frameworks, should be applied to animal health and welfare issues for the benefit of decision makers.},

abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bovine TB) is the most important animal health and welfare policy issue in Britain. Badgers are a wildlife reservoir of disease, although the eight-year Independent Scientific Group (ISG) Randomised Badger Culling Trial concluded with a recommendation against culling. The report advised government that bovine TB could be controlled, and ultimately eradicated, by cattle-based measures alone. Despite the ISG recommendation against culling, the farming and veterinary industries continued to lobby government for a badger cull. The 2005-2010 Labour government followed the ISG advice and decided against a cull. The 2010-2015 Coalition and the 2015-present Conservative governments have followed a badger culling policy. This paper investigates whether a virtuous government would cull badgers. It provides an overview of virtue theory in the context of government animal health and welfare policy. Bovine TB and badger control policy options are then analysed in the context of the virtues of justice, wisdom, integrity, loyalty, curiosity, trust, empathy, compassion and aesthetics. Justice is the first virtue of government, and badger culling is seriously problematic from a virtue perspective given that five badgers are culled per cow that avoids slaughter as a result. Analysis based on other virtues strongly suggests that government should not cull badgers. The paper concludes that a virtuous government would not cull badgers as part of policy to control bovine TB in cattle.},

abstract = {1. Long-term individual-based datasets on host-pathogen systems are a rare and valuable resource for understanding the infectious disease dynamics in wildlife. A study of European badgers (Meles meles) naturally infected with bovine tuberculosis (bTB) at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire (UK) has produced a unique dataset, facilitating investigation of a diverse range of epidemiological and ecological questions with implications for disease management. 2. Since the 1970s, this badger population has been monitored with a systematic mark-recapture regime yielding a dataset of >15,000 captures of >3,000 individuals, providing detailed individual life-history, morphometric, genetic, reproductive and disease data. 3. The annual prevalence of bTB in the Woodchester Park badger population exhibits no straightforward relationship with population density, and both the incidence and prevalence of Mycobacterium bovis show marked variation in space. The study has revealed phenotypic traits that are critical for understanding the social structure of badger populations along with mechanisms vital for understanding disease spread at different spatial resolutions. 4. Woodchester-based studies have provided key insights into how host ecology can influence infection at different spatial and temporal scales. Specifically, it has revealed heterogeneity in epidemiological parameters; intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting population dynamics; provided insights into senescence and individual life histories; and revealed consistent individual variation in foraging patterns, refuge use and social interactions. 5. An improved understanding of ecological and epidemiological processes is imperative for effective disease management. Woodchester Park research has provided information of direct relevance to bTB management, and a better appreciation of the role of individual heterogeneity in disease transmission can contribute further in this regard. 6. The Woodchester Park study system now offers a rare opportunity to seek a dynamic understanding of how individual-, group- and population-level processes interact. The wealth of existing data makes it possible to take a more integrative approach to examining how the consequences of individual heterogeneity scale to determine population-level pathogen dynamics and help advance our understanding of the ecological drivers of host-pathogen systems.},

abstract = {1. Trapping and hunting records are frequently used as an index of animal abundance. This study demonstrates that these records can be misleading if sampling effort is not controlled for. 2. Mean numbers of stoats Mustela erminea and weasels M. nivalis trapped by British gamekeepers have been decreasing since 1975 and 1961 respectively, giving rise to concern that populations of both species may be declining. However, trapping effort has not been quantified over this period. 3. A total of 203 gamekeepers in England were questioned about the trapping effort they expended and the number of stoats and weasels they trapped in 1997. The most significant factor affecting the number of stoats and weasels trapped was trapping effort. 4, Gamekeepers that relied on hand-rearing game birds for shooting regarded stoats and weasels as a less serious problem, and made substantially less trapping effort, than gamekeepers that relied on wild game birds. 5. The national decline in the numbers of stoats and weasels trapped may be the result of a decline in stoat and weasel populations. However, the decline is equally consistent with a reduction in trapping effort, corresponding to a national increase in reliance on hand-rearing game birds for shooting. 6. When the effect of trapping effort was controlled for, the number of weasels trapped by gamekeepers in 1997 was significantly lower in the south-west than in other regions of England and was unusually low in some local areas. 7. Trapping records can be used effectively to monitor populations of stoats and weasels, as long as gamekeepers record the number of traps set in each month and monthly totals of animals killed. Ideally, the sex of each animal and whether it was trapped or shot should also be recorded. Similar modifications should also be made to other wildlife monitoring schemes based on trapping and hunting records.},

abstract = {1. British gamekeepers commonly trap and shoot stoats and weasels in order to increase the abundance of game. We provide details of the population biology of 822 stoats and 458 weasels collected on 25 game estates and use simple population models to assess the effects of culling. 2. Seventy-one per cent of stoats and 94% of weasels were trapped, while 26% of stoats and 5% of weasels were shot. While trapped samples exhibited typically male-biased sex ratios, the sex ratio of shot stoats was even. Eight of 305 female stoats and six of 77 female weasels were visibly pregnant, with mean litters of 9.0 and 6.2 embryos, respectively. Median ages at death were 11.6. and 8.0 months for male and female stoats, respectively, and 9.3 and 9.2 months for male and female weasels. Male and female stoats, but not male and female weasels, had significantly different rates of survival. 3. Model weasel populations continued to increase (lambda = 1.35) despite culling as a result of high productivity when sufficient food was available. Model stoat populations declined slightly (lambda = 0.95), probably as a result of concerted culling effort when young stoats were dependent on maternal survival. This suggests that persistence of culled stoat populations may depend on immigration. 4. To reduce stoat populations without affecting the survival of dependent juveniles, culling effort could be focused on trapping females in late winter and shooting females in early spring, where landscape and climate permit. For control of weasel populations, trapping effort should be, and in practice often is, focused on late spring, following a period of high natural mortality. 5. High rates of immigration mean that culling by gamekeepers will not ordinarily lead to any long-term decline in actual stoat and weasel populations. We suggest that measures taken to enhance immigration will improve the long-term status of stoats and weasels in regions where their conservation is desirable, and whilst this persists the impact of culling will be short-lived and local.},

They exist independently of contemporary human settlement at only two sites both of which are important seabird breeding colonies. There may be a conflict between conserving this rare species while ensuring the welfare of seabirds. We present a case study of the potential conservation dilemma of ship rat management on the Shiant Islands. Using capture-mark-recapture the pre-breeding rat population in May 1996 was estimated to be between 230 and 400. Evidence of rat predation on eggs and chicks was scarce at the time of our survey. The small number of rats was not thought to have a substantial effect on the nesting success of the comparatively large seabird populations. We suggest that the scientific interest of the rat population may outweigh the conservation needs of the seabirds and that formal control measures are currently unwarranted.

abstract = {Invasive species often cause the decline of native prey or competitors. We highlight a contrasting example of the large-scale recovery of a native species and the concurrent decline and likely displacement of an established invasive competitor. Invasive American mink Mustela vison became widespread in the British Isles at the same time as native Eurasian otters Lutra lutra were declining as a result of water pollution. In common with other invasive predators, mink cause conservation problems for a range of native prey species, most notably water voles Arvicola terrestris. Recent trends in the distribution of native otters and invasive mink in north-east England were examined using a novel regression modelling approach to analyse presence/absence data from field surveys, corroborated by contemporary predator culling records. Between 1991 and 2002, the percentage of sites where mink signs were found decreased from 80% to 20%, while otter signs increased from 18% to 80%. Annual indices of mink captures on shooting estates increased between 1980 and 1996, but were followed by a decline thereafter. Indices of the incidence of native otters were significantly related to those indicating the decline or displacement of invasive mink. This large-scale field study is supportive of localized experimental evidence for the return of dominant, native otters being concurrent with the decline of the invasive alien mink. The recovery of a dominant native species may represent a reversal of the mesopredator release that allowed invasive mink to establish and may eventually serve to mitigate their impact on native prey species.},

journal = {Basic and Applied Ecology},
volume = {40},
pages = {55-66},
abstract = {Across Europe agri-environment schemes (AES) have been introduced which attempt to counteract biodiversity losses relating to agricultural intensification. However, the potential benefits of AES to non-target groups such as bats are unclear. In the study presented here, we assessed how the vegetative characteristics (e.g. dicot coverage and bare ground coverage) of four commonly employed AES habitat types influenced the occurrence and activity of bats. AES plots were monitored using static acoustic bat detectors and each plot was surveyed three times between April and September, with detectors set to record over three consecutive nights during each survey. Analysis of this data identified some preferences for specific AES habitat characteristics by bats, but preferences differed between species. Relationships between bats and AES habitat type were not investigated due to structural similarities between habitats which were identified through principal component analysis. Our study therefore identifies simple species-specific habitat management practices which could be implemented as part of current AES to increase the suitability of these habitats to bats. For example, habitat management targeted towards Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Barbastellus barbastellus could focus on providing floristically diverse foraging sites, which are attractive to their invertebrate prey, in close proximity to potential woodland roost sites, whilst Pipistrellus pipistrellus may benefit from AES with high dicot coverage if such habitats are located along tall field boundaries with trees, which provide shelter for their prey.

The predicted percentage of records spent by lactating females in direct contact with the young on day 1 of lactation did not differ significantly from 100%. This declined to 13% on day 50 of lactation. Over time, the mothers groomed the young less. Lactating females visited the roost more times per night, but spent less time self grooming than non-reproductive females. The total amount of grooming behaviour (estimated as the percentage of records spent in self grooming plus those allocated to grooming of the young) for lactating females was 50% of the value for non-reproductive females. In general, care-giving behaviours declined with the progress of lactation. The temporal expression of these behaviours was opposite in direction to that of the expected energetic demands of milk production. (C) 1997 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

The energy budgets of lactating and non-reproductive female Brown Long-Eared Bats fed primarily on noctuid moths (approximate to 27.2 kJ g(-1)) were constructed and compared in flight enclosures in captivity. 2. The average dry food consumption of non-reproductive individuals was 1.8 g bat(-1) day(-1) (gross energy intake = 48 kJ day(-1)). The average food consumption throughout days 10-35 of lactation was 2.0 g bat(-1) day(-1) (gross energy intake = 53 kJ day(-1)). Lactating females obtained six times more energy from increased food consumption than from mobilization of fat stores, compared with non-reproductive bats. 3. Milk export, calculated using the difference in water turnover between lactating and non-reproductive bats (measured using H-2 turnover) averaged 2.6 ml bat(-1) day(-1) (22.9 kJ day(-1)). This was similar to the average milk intake of sucklings estimated from H-3 turnover (22.9 kJ day(-1)). 4. Energy available for respiration from food and mobilization of fat stores was 18.2 kJ day(-1) for lactating females compared with 36.8 kJ day(-1) for non-reproductive females. In comparison, respiratory daily energy expenditure (DEE) of lactating and non-reproductive bats, measured by doubly labelled water (DLW), was 21.3 kJ day(-1) and 23.6 kJ day(-1), respectively. Hence, there was a discrepancy between respiratory DEE (measured by DLW) and net available energy estimates for non-reproductive bats but not for lactating bats. 5. Respiratory DEE for lactating bats was equal to or less than that of non-reproductive females, suggesting they used compensatory mechanisms in their energy budgets in lactation.},

abstract = {We measured basal metabolic rate (BMR) of nonreproductive and of breeding (pregnant and lactating) female brown long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus) to investigate the effects of intra- and interindividual variation in body mass and of reproduction on metabolism. The BMR of six nonreproductive females was measured between five and seven times at approximately 2-wk intervals over a period of 2.5 mo. There was a highly significant effect (P < 0.001) of body mass on BMR of these nonreproductive females. The pooled within-individual scaling exponent (1.88) significantly exceeded the established mammalian interspecific exponent (0.75). In addition, we made single observations on 14 nonreproductive females to establish the effects of differences in mass between individuals. The mean BMR across all 14 individuals was 82 mW (+/-24 SD). There was a significant positive relationship between BMR and body mass across these individuals (r(2) = 0.39), with a between-individual scaling exponent of 0.75. Inter- and intraindividual effects of mass on BMR were combined in a regression analysis that included mean body mass and deviation from mean mass on any given day as predictors. This regression model explained 55% of the variation in BMR. We made longitudinal measurements of BMR throughout reproduction and compared these with the predicted BMR of nonreproductive bats of the same body mass. Reproductive females exhibited temporal flexibility in BMR. BMR during pregnancy increased on a whole-animal basis but was significantly lower (by, on average, 15%) than BMR predicted for nonreproductive females of the same mass. Over a period of 1-75 d following birth, whole-animal BMR was greater than that during pregnancy, even though body mass declined after parturition. Hence, postbirth BMR was greater than the level predicted for nonreproductive females of the same mass. This study indicates that the scaling of BMR with body mass differs significantly within and between individuals and that there is a reduction of BMR in pregnancy and an elevation of BMR during lactation.},

abstract = {Individuals are predicted to maximize lifetime reproductive success (LRS) through selective use of resources; however, a wide range of ecological and social processes may prevent individuals from always using the highest-quality resources available. Resource selection functions (RSFs) estimate the relative amount of time an individual spends using a resource as a function of the proportional availability of that resource. We quantified the association between LRS and coefficients of individual-based RSFs describing lifetime resource selection for 267 female red deer (Cervus elaphus) of the Isle of Rum, Scotland, from 1970 to 2001. LRS was significantly related to first- and second-order effects of selection for Agrostis/Testuca grassland and proximity to the sea coast (quality of forage within Agrostis/Testuca grassland was highest nearest the coast (ratio of short: long grassland)). The benefits of selecting for quality in AgrostislTestuca grassland, however, traded-off with increases in LRS gained by avoiding conspecific density. LRS was inversely associated with local density, which was highest along the coast, and reproductive benefits of selecting Agrostis/Festuca grassland diminished with increasing density. We discuss the relevance of these results to our understanding of the spatial distribution of red deer abundance, and potential applications of our approach to evolutionary and applied ecology.},

abstract = {We used long-term data on movements, survival, and reproduction of female red deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus) of the Isle of Rum, Scotland (1970-2001), to explain variation in life history (age at maturity) from a hind's access to habitat resources and exposure to local density, and cross-generational (maternal) effects on observed relationships. We described each hind's use of resources relative to availability in the study area from an individual-based resource selection function (RSF); we defined local density as the total number of hinds aged >= 1 year within the subpopulation cluster to which an individual belonged. The likelihood of a hind producing her first calf in the period from birth to the end of the summer in which she turned age 3 was positively related to relative use of Agrostis/Festuca grasslands and other low-elevation communities, and inversely related to a hind's mean annual local density. However, when we considered both a daughter's RSF and exposure to local density and her mother's RSF and exposure to local density, maternal data alone most parsimoniously explained variation in age at maturity of daughters. Mothers were able to lower age at maturity in their daughters in two, non-mutually exclusive ways. First, birth mass of daughters was inversely related to age at maturity, and mothers that used relatively less uplands (Calluna-dominated heath and heather moorland) and occupied areas of lower density produced larger offspring. Second, mothers could establish a home range that enabled daughters to mature in areas with access to high quality Agrostis/Festuca grasslands at low density. Lifetime reproductive success was inversely associated with a hind's age at maturity via extension of the reproductive life span. Longevity did not change in association with age at maturity. Patterns in how animals use available habitat resources may depend on that of previous generations, especially at larger scales of resource selection.},

abstract = {Monitoring postrelease establishment and movement of animals is important in evaluating conservation translocations. We translocated 39 wild pine martens Martes martes (19 females, 20 males) from Scotland to Wales. We released them into forested areas with no conspecifics in 2015, followed by a second release in 2016, alongside the previously released animals. We used radio-tracking to describe postrelease movement and habitat selection. Six martens (15%) were not re-encountered during the tracking period, of which four undertook long-distance dispersal. For the remaining individuals, we characterized two phases of movement, "exploration" followed by "settlement," that differed between releases. In the first release, martens remained in exploration phase for a mean of 14.5 days (SE = 3.9 days) and settled at a mean distance of 8.7 km (SE = 1.8 km) from release sites, whereas martens released in year two, alongside resident conspecifics, traveled away from release sites at a faster rate, settling sooner, at a mean of 6.6 days (SE = 1.8 days), but further, at a mean distance of 14.0 km (SE = 1.7 km) from release sites. Animals released in year one did not exhibit habitat preferences overall but within forests they favored recently felled areas, whereas animals released in year two showed strong selection for forested habitat but did not discriminate between forest types. The presence of conspecifics appeared influential for settlement and site fidelity of translocated martens and was associated with more rapid but more distant dispersal of the later cohort. Releases of animals in close proximity appeared to promote site fidelity and rapid establishment of ranges in the recipient environment.},

abstract = {The European wildcat, Felis silvestris, faces a number of threats to its population in Scotland and continental Europe. Population minimums probably occurred in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Several populations have recovered since, due to some restoration of preferred habitat and a reduction in persecution. Our study of European wildcats in Scotland found that direct killing because of alleged attacks on gamebirds and livestock still occurred. Accidental killing by dogs, snares or poison baits is probably still common. Viral diseases, such as feline leukaemia have recently been identified. Low levels of dieldrin were detected in two wildcats, but few other toxic agrochemicals were found. A major threat to European wildcats is the loss of speciation due to hybridization with domestic cats. Many introgressive hybrids are now reported. These can be readily detected by skull measurements and coat markings. Major reintroduction programs are probably not necessary to ''save'' the wildcat, but local education of hunters, reductions in feral domestic cats and instigation of wildlife management procedures would greatly enhance the outlook for the species.},

abstract = {1. Principal environmental factors predicting local variations in hedgehog abundance were sought from surveys of 58 fields of grazing pasture at six sites of 12-15 km2 in Oxfordshire, UK. Comparable surveys were additionally conducted on 31 mown grass playing fields in the same region. Complementary information on presence or absence of hedgehogs was obtained from a questionnaire survey of farmers. 2. Presence or absence of hedgehogs and their abundance in the pasture fields correlated with the magnitudes of five environmental variables. In a Principal Components Analysis, pasture fields in which hedgehogs were present were grouped together along a predator axis, characterized by indicators of badger activity and distance from town, and a resource axis, characterized by indices of earthworm availability. These factors together accounted for 44% of the variation in hedgehog abundance. 3. The abundance of hedgehogs varied in direct relation to the density of badger setts as a single variable. Absence of hedgehogs from all but a few isolated pockets in a site was predicted at densities of greater-than-or-equal-to 2.27 badger setts per 10 km2 (0.01 to 7.16 at 95% confidence limits). 4. Mown grass playing fields were generally closer to towns than pasture fields and sustained higher densities of hedgehogs, with 3.9 +/- 0.8 per field compared to 0.7 +/- 0.2 in pasture fields. Food resources appeared to be more abundant than in pasture fields and did not contribute to explaining presence or abundance of hedgehogs in playing fields. In a Principal Components Analysis, a mortality axis and an isolation axis explained 39% of variance in abundance. 5. We compare these results to data from experimental studies, and conclude that local variations in the abundance of hedgehogs can be related to the distribution of a principal predator and a major food resource, and that isolation from neighbouring populations explains the absence of hedgehogs from a small proportion of sites which are otherwise suitable.},

abstract = {Variation in demographic rates within a spatially structured population could have important consequences for management decisions, harvesting strategies and offtake rates. Although there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that demographic rates vary within populations over a range of spatial scales, there has been little research investigating the consequences of this variation for population management. In this paper, data on the dynamics of two female red deer sub-populations on Rum are analysed, and evidence is presented for differences between the fecundity and mortality rates of the two sub-populations. A simple harvesting model is developed to represent the dynamics of the two sub-populations, including density-independent migration between sub-populations and spatially correlated environmental variability. The highest monetary yield in the model is obtained by harvesting the more resilient sub-population at a higher rate. Surprisingly the losses involved in harvesting both sub-populations at the same rate are insignificant. However, if migration were density-dependent, the size of one sub-population would be more relevant to harvesting policy for the other sub-population. The results of this empirical study are compared to theoretical work on spatially structured populations; it is shown that when a species has complex age- and sex-structured population dynamics, previous theoretical results may not hold.},

abstract = {Lead, zinc, and cadmium were determined in a range of tissues from wild populations of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) trapped on an abandoned metalliferous mine site and a reference site. Estimated dietary intakes indicated that animals were exposed to elevated levels of all three metals at the mine site, and this was generally reflected in metal residues in body tissues. Lead concentrations were significantly higher in all tissues of animals from the mine compared to the reference site, while Cd was higher only in the kidney. There was evidence of age-accumulation (using total body weight as an index of age) of Cd in both the liver and kidney of mine site animals but no evidence of such accumulation of lead in bone. In contrast to Cd and Pb, Zn was lower in the tissues of mine site animals compared to the reference site. Based on critical tissue concentrations, the ecotoxicological risk to a wild population of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), associated with total substrate levels of 1 mug g(-1) dry weight Cd and 700 mug g(-1) dry weight Zn at this mine site is negligible, but that associated with 4000 mug g(-1) dry weight Pb may be considered significant.},

abstract = {A comparative study of the concentrations of cadmium in ecosystems developed on tailings from lead/zinc mines was undertaken. Mine soils, vegetation, ground-dwelling invertebrates and Apodemus sylvaticus from nine historic and abandoned mines in Wales and a modern Irish mine site were sampled in order to evaluate and compare exposure risks to wildlife. There were three high soil cadmium sites (155-300 mg kg(-1)) all from north-east Wales sites, one intermediate site (21 mg kg(-1)) the Irish mine tailings, with the other sites having low (background) cadmium levels. The cadmium levels reflected differences in ore minerology and in particular the presence of the zinc ore, sphalerite. The highest plant and invertebrate cadmium levels generally occurred in the three high soil cadmium sites. However, occasional high levels were found in plant and invertebrate samples from one or more of the low cadmium sites. Of particular significance was, despite the relatively high soil cadmium, the very low cadmium concentrations in the plants and invertebrates from the Irish tailings. Evidence of food-chain transfer and even biomagnification in invertebrates did not lead to high cadmium levels in kidneys of A. sylvaticus. Only at one high site were the kidney cadmium residues significantly higher than the reference site.},

volume = {20},
number = {5},
pages = {455-462},
abstract = {While the effects of wind farms on bats are widely studied, effects of small wind turbines (SWTs, here <25m hub height) remain understudied. SWTs are installed in a wider range of habitats compared to wind farms and their effect on wildlife can therefore be different. While single SWTs can adversely affect bat activity in their immediate vicinity, they are often installed in clusters, and to date, no data are available on whether installation of more than one turbine increases the likelihood of adverse effects on bats. Here, we test whether (1) SWT installations affect the activity of two species of bat (the common pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus and soprano pipistrelle P. pygmaeus) on a landscape scale (here defined as up to 500m from SWTs) and (2) such an effect is stronger when multiple (2-4) SWTs are installed. We show that, after accounting for potentially confounding effects (e.g. variation in habitat and weather), (1) mean P. pipistrellus activity is lower at 0-100m compared to 200-500m from SWTs and (2) the effect on P. pygmaeus activity tends to be similar and stronger in multiple SWT sites, although evidence for the latter is limited. We conclude that in some cases, adverse effects of SWTs on bat activity may be measurable over longer spatial scales (within 100m) than previously thought. However, combined with earlier findings, it is likely that the bulk of such effects operate within relative close proximity of SWTs (<25m). Moreover, although these effects may be species-specific, with, for example, P. pygmaeus potentially more strongly affected by multiple SWT sites, this requires further data. These findings are highly relevant to decision-making aimed at minimizing any adverse effects of wind turbines, specifically single- versus multiple SWT developments, on wildlife.},

journal = {Biological Conservation},
volume = {37},
number = {3},
pages = {237-267},
abstract = {Most of Britain's red deer live at high density on some of Britain' least fertile land, i.e. poor hill-land in Scotland, which has lost most of its original woodland. For well over a century, deer have been actively conserved on such land, on privately owned estates known as ‘deer-forests’, devoted mainly to deer-stalking (i.e. stag hunting with a rifle), but with venison output also becoming important latterly. This land is both atypical and suboptimal as red deer habitat, and these deer are markedly poorer in performance than those in their more usual woodland habitats elsewhere.

For information relevant to improved harvesting, red deer were studied over a 9-year period at Glendeshie, a 16 600 ha deer-forest in the Cairngorms. Here the population density was 30% higher than average for Scottish hill-land, and deer performance was comparable with other high-density populations in Scotland. Early growth was slow, and puberty in hinds relatively late. Whereas some hinds in low-density populations can be sexually mature as yearlinhs (
), no pregnant yearlings or lactating 2-year-olds occurred at Glenfeshie. Each year, about 34% of the adult hinds failed to breed, giving rise to the high frequency of ‘yeld’ adult hinds which typify populations in this type of habitat. The birthrate of about 44 calves per 100 hinds was probably a little lower than average for Scottish hill-land, but much lower than in the best red deer habitats where all hinds are mature as yearlings and able to breed every year thereafter.

Apart from losses of calves soon after birth, most natural mortality was in late winter and early spring, but the incidence was quite low over the study period due to unusually mild winters. The main causes seemed to be under-nutrition and exposure which affected individuals already in poor condition, i.e. stunted youngsters and adults past their best years.

It was estimated that the population could sustain an annual crop of about 15% of the adult stock, this being about twice the traditional level. Although carcase-meat production (about 1 kg ha−1 year−1) would be still low by agricultural standards, such land would otherwise be difficult to exploit, and other income arises from leasing out stalking. However, the actual cropping-rate would have to be reviewed periodically; it would be impossible to anticipate the effects of severe winters or of neighbouring management changes. Therefore, much depends on regular stock assessment, and since individual deer-forests seldom contain discrete deer populations, efficient management must also depend on co-operation among those exploiting a common stock.},

volume = {30},

pages = {219-227},
abstract = {Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are believed to have an economic impact on farming through predation on lambs, poultry and game. Investigation of the causes behind variation in the impact of predation between farms is required to improve management of these problems. A questionnaire survey of sheep farmers was combined with field data on relative fox population abundance to investigate some of the factors associated with both the occurrence and scale of perceived fox predation in Britain. Reported lamb losses to foxes were generally low but there was a large range in perceived levels of predation, from 0.0008 to 0.26 lambs per ewe, with 59% of respondents reporting that they had lost at least one lamb to a fox at their most recent lambing. Flock size was an important factor determining perceived fox predation. Fox predation was more likely to have occurred on larger farms, but, when it did, fewer lambs were perceived lost per ewe. Various other non-management characteristics, including regional location, had an influence on fox predation. Fox abundance was positively associated with perceived predation. Indoor lambing was an important preventive measure against fox predation. However, the effect of fox control on livestock predation was difficult to determine because of potential reactive behaviour by farmers to lamb losses. The analyses indicate that multivariate rather than univariate techniques should be used in the assessment of predator impacts and in making management recommendations. The identification of farm characteristics associated with fox predation, such as location and indoor lambing, enables the potential identification of problem farms where preventive management should be targeted.},

abstract = {Economic analysis is a useful tool to aid decisions on what to do about wildlife impacts, such as those of vertebrate predators on livestock farmers. The case-study of lamb predation by foxes in Britain is used to develop a theoretical economic model, with the aim of determining a financially optimal solution to minimise the total costs of livestock predation at the farm-level. Total costs include output losses and expenditure on preventive and control measures, in this case indoor housing and lethal fox control. The model is tested empirically with data from a questionnaire survey of sheep farmers and field data on fox population densities in Britain. Regression analyses are used to determine the relationships between lamb losses and expenditure on indoor housing, fox population density and other non-management characteristics. The effect of fox abundance on the cost of fox control is also assessed. Marginal analysis is used to determine the total cost-minimising solution from the farmer's point-of-view, in terms of how many ewes should be housed indoors and for how long, as well as how many foxes should be killed in addition to any lethal control already carried out. Optimal solutions vary according to farm characteristics, including flock size and the regional location of farms. In all cases, to minimise the costs of predation, as many ewes as possible should be housed. However, it is not worthwhile housing them for more than a day after lambing. Efficient fox predation management does not necessarily mean that lamb losses should be reduced to zero, and additional fox control is not worthwhile on the majority of farms. The analysis provides a framework for future evaluations of wildlife impacts and cost-effective management of these problems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A species' habitat niche width informs its position on the generalist-specialist continuum, which is central to life-history theory and crucial to conservation planning. However, assessments of niche width are often based on local-scale studies or qualitative descriptions rather than broad, quantitative assessments conducted in heterogeneous landscapes. Here, we show how broad-scale, hierarchical occupancy models can clarify a species' niche width and degree of habitat specialism by evaluating the woodland-specialist classification of the European pine marten Martes martes. We deployed 526 camera-trap stations at 27 sites throughout a vast extent (similar to 50000km(2)) in Scotland and modeled pine marten occupancy as a function of habitat characteristics using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis. Our model was flexible to trap happiness due to baiting at camera traps and accounted for spatial autocorrelation among and imperfect detection at camera-trap stations. We detected a positive association between pine marten occupancy probability and wooded habitats. However, pine marten occupancy probability was also high in numerous non-wooded habitats, including agricultural land, heather and heather grassland, semi-natural grassland and areas near anthropogenic structures. Our study is the first to record high pine marten occupancy in open habitats at broad spatial scales and thereby corroborates recent smaller scale indications that pine martens are more of a habitat generalist than previously thought. Our results guide ongoing conservation efforts by identifying that pine martens are not strict woodland specialists, but rather inhabit a mosaic of habitat types in the landscape. More broadly, our case study exemplifies how coupling hierarchical occupancy models with large-scale experimental designs can clarify a species' niche width and associated position on the generalist-specialist continuum.},

abstract = {Translocation is frequently used to return rehabilitated animals to the wild, and is an important tool for the population management of endangered species. Whilst experimental field manipulations are important in determining optimal rehabilitation and translocation strategies, they are rarely implemented in practice. We used an experimental approach to examine the effects of translocation on post-release survival and behaviour, and the impact of introductions on the recipient wild population, using the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), the most common mammal admitted to British wildlife hospitals. The post-release survival and behaviour of five groups were compared: three different translocation treatments, one wild population at the release sites and one control wild population away from the release sites. individuals that were held in captivity prior to translocation had a better survival rate on release than individuals that were translocated with a minimum time spent in captivity. We suggest that temporary captivity improves chances of survival by allowing the build up of fat reserves and reducing manipulation stress suffered on release. No evidence was found for intra-specific competition between introduced individuals and the recipient wild hedgehog population. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

They are able to allocate more time to feeding and have an increased corporate vigilance as group size increases. However, these benefits are conditional upon the food distribution. When food is spaced, all individuals benefit. When it is clumped into a small defendable patch, dominant hares attempt to monopolize the resource. They can successfully exclude subordinates when group size is small but, as group size increases, they must devote more time to defending the patch. Therefore, dominants spend less time feeding with increasing group size, while subordinates spend more, since they have more opportunity to feed while the dominant hare is off chasing other individuals. As a consequence, when more than two hares are present, all individuals do less well when food is clumped than when it is spaced.},

In rats and mice, high all-year birth rates, high levels of dispersal and promiscuous mating systems suggest that, if immunocontraception was used alone, >90% of the population would have to sterilized to achieve the desired control. In Britain, the grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) may be a better candidate to investigate the feasibility of a contraceptive vaccine in rodents. This introduced species is a seasonal breeder with a much lower population turnover than rats or mice. As well as causing damage to woodland, it has ousted the native red squirrel (S. valgaris) from most of the UK. A humane and selective method for the control of grey squirrels is therefore highly desirable. Numerous sperm-specific antigens have been identified on rodent spermatozoa. Monoclonal antibodies to particular components block sperm-egg interactions in laboratory animals and cross-react with grey squirrel spermatozoa. In vitro fertilization assays indicate that squirrel sperm-egg binding may be inhibited also. Currently, a cDNA library obtained from grey squirrel testis is being screened to identify genes encoding specific sperm antigens involved in fertilization. Methods of enhancing immunogenicity after oral immunization using microparticle carriers and immune-stimulating complexes are currently under investigation.},

abstract = {1. In response to reported increases in badger numbers and associated agricultural damage, a questionnaire survey of 3600 land owner/occupiers was conducted in 1997 to determine the extent and significance of badger damage in England and Wales. We assess the significance of badger-induced damage and highlight problem regions, farm types and specific crops to allow targeting of future research efforts at amelioration. (This survey investigated alleged badger damage to agriculture but did not address the role of badgers in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis.) 2. The return rate of the questionnaire was 55.1% (n = 1982) and 150 of the responses were ground-truthed. 3. Almost 30% of those land owner/occupiers who responded reported that badger damage had occurred in the previous 12 months, and 57% reported an increase in damage during the past 5 years. 4. Badger damage was widespread, but its incidence was highly dependent on region and farm type. The most frequently reported damage (25.5%) resulted from badgers' burrowing activities (especially those causing damage to fences). Crop damage was also frequently reported (21.2%), with wheat, forage maize and vines being damaged most frequently. 5. Ground-truthing showed that incorrect attribution to badgers of damage was negligible and that the majority of respondents had assessed correctly the extent and cost of badger damage, except for predation on livestock where most 'evidence' was circumstantial. 6. Most reported damage was of little economic consequence to individual land owners/occupiers; however, approximately 5% estimated that they had incurred costs of over pound 1000. 7. Assuming that the questionnaires returned were a random subset of those distributed, the mean estimated national cost was pound 41.5 million per annum (62% of which was due to burrowing activity). Assuming that all the non-respondents had no damage, the estimate was pound 21.5 million per annum. 8. Future research into management options for damage limitation should be targeted at the areas and situations of most significant damage. These are primarily burrowing damage and direct crop damage to wheat, maize, vines, fruit and vegetables. The region suffering the most intense damage was the south-west of England. The highly seasonal nature of the damage to some crops will allow preventative action to be taken at the most appropriate times. Predation by badgers on livestock is considered a small-scale and unproven problem.},

A second burrow, begun a month later, at a higher elevation on the beach, lasted <1 day due to mechanical collapse. A third high-shore burrow lasted 21 days. Rabbit activity along the high shore was observed directly and evidenced indirectly (by monitoring tracks). Feeding scrapes were frequently noted at the bases of Ammophila arenaria and at the roots of Potentilla anserina. The prostrate foliage and roots of Halimione (=Atriplex) glabriuscula and upright shoots of Raphanus maritimus plants were also heavily grazed. Stranded algae (mostly Fucus spp.) of different ages (from fresh to well decomposed) were also exploited and some feeding scrapes were even observed in apparently clean sand. Perhaps rabbits foraged there for comminuted seaweed fragments incorporated into the beach. The possibility of marine macroalgal consumption by rabbits having a wide choice of vascular plant species in summer appears not to have been reported before.},

abstract = {1. In populations of small mammals, food supplementation typically results in higher population densities, body weights, growth rates and reproductive rates. However, few studies have demonstrated a relationship between forage levels and demographic rates in wild populations in the absence of supplementation. 2. We examined the association of levels of available forage with individual growth rates and time to sexual maturity in eight re-introduced and three naturally occurring populations of water voles (Arvicola terrestris). 3. Range sizes were smaller at sites with higher population densities. Mean forage availability and individual growth rates covaried with range size at each site. 4. The weight at which water voles became sexually mature was 112 g for females and 115 g for males and did not vary between study sites. Differences in growth rates therefore translated into differences in the time taken to reach maturity between sites. 5. In the re-introduced populations, mean days to maturity varied inversely with mean range length. Females took 7 days (18%, range 40-47 days) longer and males 5 days (13%, range 40-45 days) longer to reach breeding condition at the sites with the shortest mean range lengths. 6. Evidence from this study suggests a possible mechanism by which increased population densities may reduce maturation rates in water voles through a reduction in mean range size, thereby limiting the availability of forage to each individual.},

abstract = {Reintroductions are an important tool in conservation biology but frequently fail. Factors influencing reintroduction 'success' are rarely tested experimentally. We examined the relationship between habitat quality and reintroduction success in an experimental reintroduction of populations of water voles (Aruicola terrestris) in the UK. We released cohorts of 44 water voles into 12 replicate 800 m stretches of river, each supporting a different habitat abundance. Water voles initially established at nine sites, failing to establish at three sites due to predation from American mink (two sites) and atypically severe flooding post-release (one site). For sites where voles established, at those with higher vegetation abundance more of the release cohort survived (initial survival rates range 0.43-0.61), and post-establishment survival rates (range 0.45-0.80) and population densities (range 2.1-5.4 voles per 100 m of habitat) were higher. A further two populations were lost to American mink predation post-establishment. Reintroductions are commonly designated as either a 'success' or a 'failure'. The principal cause of a failed release in our study was insufficient mink control. However, whilst seven of our 12 reintroductions were 'successful', our results indicated substantial variation in the population densities and survival rates that the replicate habitats could support. This highlights the need to ensure that any habitat selected for a reintroduction is the best obtainable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

volume = {86},

pages = {655-661},
abstract = {Female small mammals are often territorial. Two hypotheses explaining territoriality of females predict that females should exclude competing females from territorial boundaries. For water voles, these hypotheses allow either static territoriality, in which the geographical locations of territories remain constant, or drifting territoriality, in which the locations of territories constantly shift. If females defended entire territories over short periods, gains and losses of habitat would be actively competed for, potentially resulting in static territoriality. We attempted to discern whether water vole territories drift, and why, and whether territories at high densities are more static, by analyzing patterns of short-term and long-tenn range use at different population densities. Water voles were radiotracked at 2 study sites, 1 supporting a high population density and I supporting a low population density. Range sizes of females did not reach asymptotes with increasing observations at either site, and the geographical locations of their ranges constantly shifted via gains and losses of habitat. The degree to which territories of females shifted was larger at the low-population-density site. These range-use patterns could be partially explained by mating behavior in which males and females interacted closely for extended periods, potentially leaving areas of the females' territories undefended. We conclude that female water voles exhibit drifting territoriality, that this may partially result from inherent flexibility in their territories due to mating behavior, and that the degree to which territories drifted was smaller at higher density.},

abstract = {1. Radio-tracking is used ubiquitously in studies of wild vertebrates, a fundamental assumption being that tagged animals do not significantly differ, behaviourally or otherwise, from untagged animals. 2. We studied two populations of water voles Arvicola terrestris: one population was live-trapped from April to September for 2 years (2000, 2001) and then concurrently radio-tracked and trapped in a third year (2002). The second population was trapped only during 2002. 3. During 2002, a substantial decline in female numbers in the radio-collared population was recorded, apparently resulting from a male skew in the sex ratios of offspring born to this population. The mean numbers of males and females born during trapping only were 25.7 (SD 2.1) and 29.0 (SD 7.0), respectively. Recruits to the radio-tracked population were skewed heavily in favour of males (43 : 13). 4. Both hypotheses commonly invoked to explain mammalian sex-ratio manipulation refer to the condition of mothers. The altered sex ratio resulted from a 48% decrease in numbers of females born, a decrease similar to the proportion (0.49) of the female population that was collared. No similar decline in male births occurred. This suggests that radio-collaring of females caused male-skewed sex ratios. 5. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the observed decline in female numbers resulted from male-skewed recruitment sex ratios due to the attachment of radio-collars to female water voles. These results question the assumption that the use of radio-collars does not fundamentally affect the biology of collared water voles.},

abstract = {In many mammalian species, females compete with each other for food and space to raise offspring, while males compete with each other for access to females. Few studies have examined the factors which limit male range sizes or the degree of overlap between male ranges. We deduced four possible responses of the range sizes of non-territorial male small mammals to increasing population density and/ or levels of forage abundance. These were: (1) male range sizes might remain the same irrespective of population density; (2) at high population densities males may become territorial, and their ranges small and non-overlapping; (3) at high forage abundance/population densities, males' ranges may become smaller but remain intra-sexually overlapping; (4) at high forage abundance, male range sizes may increase. We examined the relationship between population density, range lengths and range overlaps and body weights of both sexes in a comparative study of three populations of water voles Arvicola terrestris. Male range sizes were smaller at higher population densities, but their ranges remained both inter-and intrasexually overlapping. Heavier males had larger ranges than did lighter males at all sites. These results comply with what would be expected if male range sizes were at least partially restricted by the number of ranges of other individuals with which they overlapped. Although we could not discount the hypothesis that forage abundance may also have had a direct effect on male range sizes, our results implied that male range sizes were at least partially determined by social factors.},

pages = {109-116},
abstract = {Semi-natural agricultural habitats have declined in northern Europe since the 1950s, to the detriment of habitat connectivity and biodiversity. European agri-environmental schemes to restore them should target the habitats most likely to remedy these impacts. We employed a stochastic individual-based simulation model to predict movements of a model species, the European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), across a series of virtual landscapes - digitised from a typical UK lowland agricultural area - in which the abundance of hedgerow, pasture fields and field margin had been manipulated according to a factorial design. The primary landscape determinant of distances that model hedgehogs travelled was the percentage of field boundaries that were hedgerow: doubling this from the status quo resulted in an additional 13% of individuals moving 500 m, 25% 1000 m, 35% 1500 m and 51% 2000 m. Trebling the percentage of hedge yielded no additional benefit over doubling it (mean additional percentage 0.6%). Doubling the landscape percentage of pastures resulted in a 1% increase in model individuals moving 500 m and 1000 m, but decreases for 1500 m and 2000 m (-2% and -4%, respectively). Increasing the percentage of hedged fields that also had field margins led to decreases of -1% to -8% in individuals moving any distance. Agri-environmental scheme options to reinstate or repair hedges that double their percentage in lowland farmland would enhance population connectivity for European hedgehogs. Further work should extend these individual-based models to representative sets of species to explore the extent to which management for one species may benefit others. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

volume = {42},
number = {6},
pages = {1142-1151},
abstract = {The potential ranges of many species are shifting due to changing ecological conditions. Where populations become patchy towards the range edge, the realised distribution emerges from colonisation-persistence dynamics. Therefore, a greater understanding of the drivers of these processes, and the spatial scales over which they operate, presents an opportunity to improve predictions of species range expansion under environmental change. Species reintroductions offer an ideal opportunity to investigate the drivers and spatial scale of colonisation dynamics at the range edge. To this effect, we performed and monitored experimental translocations of water voles to quantify how colonisation and local persistence were influenced by habitat quality and occupancy. We used a novel statistical method to simultaneously consider effects across a range of spatial scales. Densely occupied neighbourhoods were highly persistent and frequently colonised. Persistence was more likely in high quality habitat, whereas the influence of habitat quality on colonisation was less clear. Colonisation of suitable habitat in distant, sparsely occupied areas was much less frequent than expected from the well documented high dispersal ability of the species. Persistence of these distant populations was also low, which we attribute to the absence of a rescue effect in sparsely populated neighbourhoods. Our results illustrate a mismatch between the spatial scales of colonisation dynamics in the core and edge of a species' range, suggesting that recolonisation dynamics in established populations may be a poor predictor of colonisation dynamics at the range edge. Such a mismatch leads to predictions of long lags between the emergence and colonisation of new habitat, with detrimental consequences for a species' realised distribution, conservation status and contribution to ecosystem function. Conservation translocations that also reinforce existing populations at the range edge might stimulate the rescue effect and mitigate lags in expansion.},

The rest scattered, perhaps seeking more familiar terrain. One animal died possibly not having fully recovered from its original disorder. Of the seven others, three survived at least seven weeks, but two then met with accidental deaths (drowning and road kill). Contact was lost with four animals, but circumstances suggested that they were probably still alive at least five weeks after release. There was no evidence of negative interaction with local wild hedgehogs nor any indication of difficulty with foraging, nesting or finding their nests again. Body-weights were generally maintained or increased It is concluded that rehabilitated adult hedgehogs can probably cope well with release.},

This study compared five internal and three landscape features of roosts in stone buildings with those of random and paired unoccupied buildings in Cornwall (UK) in order to determine the roost selectivity of the brown long-eared bat. Bats selected roosts mainly for their vicinity, and connection, to foraging habitat. Occupied buildings were thus more likely to be situated closer to deciduous woodland than random control buildings, and were connected through tree lines. Roosts were also found to have a roof space divided into more compartments than paired and random controls and no insulation These characteristics influence the building microclimate. These findings suggest that P auritus is selective of its roosts both at the building and the landscape levels.},

The serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) is a common and widely distributed species in Europe where it frequently harbours European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1), a virus causing rabies and transmissible to humans. In the United Kingdom, it is rare, with a distribution restricted to south of the country and so far the virus has never been found there. We investigated the genetic structure and gene flow of E. serotinus across the England and continental Europe. Greater genetic structuring was found in England compared with continental Europe. Nuclear data suggest a single population on the continent, although further work with more intensive sampling is required to confirm this, while mitochondrial sequences indicate an east-west substructure. In contrast, three distinct populations were found in England using microsatellite markers, and mitochondrial diversity was very low. Evidence of nuclear admixture indicated strong male-mediated gene flow among populations. Differences in connectivity could contribute to the high viral prevalence on the continent in contrast with the United Kingdom. Although the English Channel was previously thought to restrict gene flow, our data indicate relatively frequent movement from the continent to England highlighting the potential for movement of EBLV-1 into the United Kingdom.},

abstract = {Successful reproduction in a single breeding event has consistently been shown to reduce condition, fecundity and survival to the following breeding season. Few studies have examined the cumulative costs of frequent reproduction on survival. Here we use a dataset of female red deer (Cervus elaphus) from the Isle of Rum, Scotland, to model survival probability within a mark-recapture framework. By including both recent reproduction and long-term cumulative reproductive effort in the models we tested whether knowledge of lifetime reproductive effort improves our estimates of survival probability. We found that the fit of the model was significantly improved with the inclusion of longer-term measures of reproductive history. Heterogeneity in the reproductive performance of individuals influenced the expected survival cost of reproduction, with high cumulative reproductive effort associated with high survival, except with individuals reproducing in their first year where reproduction was associated with a decrease in survival. This work emphasises the need to account for reproductive history when estimating the survival probabilities of animals.},

abstract = {A wide range of measures are used to quantify 'individual quality', with the term often used but not defined. Here we use detailed data from a population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) to assess whether frequently used measures of individual quality are well correlated, and therefore likely to lead to comparable ecological and evolutionary insight in analyses. Correlations between measures were usually small, indicating that individuals may be considered high quality for one trait, but low quality for another. By using principal component analysis, we illustrate that there are potentially many varied individual life-history tactics within a population. This variation in tactics makes it challenging to characterize individual quality as a simple scalar; measures of heterogeneity in ecological studies should therefore be both species and question specific.},

abstract = {Most evidence for advances in phenology of in response to recent climate warming in wild vertebrate populations has come from long-term studies of birds. Few studies have either documented phenological advances or tested their climatic causes and demographic consequences in wild mammal systems. Using a long-term study of red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland, we present evidence of significant temporal trends in six phenological traits: oestrus date and parturition date in females, and antler cast date, antler clean date, rut start date and rut end date in males. These traits advanced by between 5 and 12 days across a 28-year study period. Local climate measures associated with plant growth in spring and summer (growing degree days) increased significantly over time and explained a significant amount of variation in all six phenological traits, largely accounting for temporal advances observed in some of the traits. However, there was no evidence for temporal changes in key female reproductive performance traits (offspring birth weight and offspring survival) in this population, despite significant relationships between these traits and female phenology. In males, average antler weights increased over time presumably as a result of improved resource availability and physiological condition through spring and summer. There was no evidence for any temporal change in average male annual breeding success, as might be expected if the timing of male rutting behaviour was failing to track advances in the timing of oestrus in females. Our results provide rare evidence linking phenological advances to climate warming in a wild mammal and highlight the potential complexity of relationships between climate warming, phenology and demography in wild vertebrates.},

abstract = {Reinstating forestry practices, such as coppicing, thinning the understorey and grazing, has become a key element of proposals for improving the conservation value of broadleaved woodlands in Europe. However, the consequences of such woodland management for bats are poorly understood because of a lack of knowledge concerning their habitat requirements. We studied the brown long-eared bat Plecotus auritus in South East England to determine how their patterns of habitat use could inform conservation management. Radio-tracking of 38 adult females showed that they foraged primarily in woodland and that each had a foraging area (mean = 4.4?ha) that they returned to on successive nights. Core foraging areas (mean = 2.1?ha) were characterized by more cover and greater species diversity in the understorey layer than more peripheral areas. Hedgerows were also used for foraging in the late summer and autumn. Most conservation activities for this species have focused on protecting roosts in houses and other buildings. While such protection is important for bat conservation, efforts should also be made to protect foraging habitats in woodlands by maintaining cover of native species in the understorey layer and hedgerows that provide connectivity between woodland patches. Common conservation management practices, such as reinstating coppicing or grazing in semi-natural broadleaved woodlands, could be detrimental for P.?auritus and other woodland bats. Their impact on bats should be tested experimentally before they are widely promoted as a woodland conservation strategy.},

Deer are generally the primary species involved in large mammals-vehicle collisions. Classical mitigation measures have however proven to have a limited efficacy. The development of tools aimed at predicting the real-time risk of hitting deer on a particular stretch of road can improve both human and wildlife safety, particularly if such tools can be adopted on a large scale. We analysed data on deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs) occurring on the major roads in England between 2008-2014, collected on behalf of Highways England agency. Using zero-inflated regression models, we analysed the relationships between DVCs and data on environmental, bioclimatic and traffic-related factors, on different spatial scales and for different seasons. Traffic flow, average precipitation, and a combination of suburban areas and broadleaved forest were generally associated with increased frequency of DVCs. We used the results of these models to draw seasonal risk maps, which could potentially be used to target appropriate physical mitigation or measures aimed at increasing driver awareness.

Supplementary feeding studies make the implicit and often untested assumption that supplementary feed is used by the target population. Here we describe and present the results of a supplementary feeding experiment to assess the effects of over-winter food availability on mountain hare Lepus timidus body condition, fecundity and survival in two fed and two control areas. We used passive induced transponder (PIT) tags and feeding stations equipped with PIT tag readers and data loggers to monitor individual use of supplementary feed. Fifty per cent, of 119 PIT-tagged hares, which were resident on the fed areas, used food, but individual variation in the time spent feeding was large. Food supplementation was associated with greater male body mass, earlier breeding, higher fecundity and longer survival. At the population (treatment) level these differences were not statistically significant. At the individual level the combined radio-telemetry and PIT tag data revealed a large and highly significant effect of supplementary feeding on survival. Recent syntheses of mountain hare population ecology have not identified food as a key factor determining dynamics. Our experimental study however demonstrates that food may have profound effects on individuals. In addition our study raises critical questions about the design and interpretation of supplementary feeding studies.},

We captured 41 adult female hares in October 2002; 22 were treated with Ivermectin to remove parasites and 19 were left untreated as controls. The treated and untreated hares were culled in May 2003 together with a second control group of nine unhandled hares.

journal = {Biological Conservation},

pages = {38-49},
abstract = {In many countries, bats have high conservation prioritisation owing to their trophic position, habitat associations and threat level, and many have dedicated management plans. However, poor knowledge of species' ecology, identification issues and surveying challenges mean that large-scale monitoring to produce required distribution and abundance information is less developed than for some other taxa. Static detectors deployed to record bats throughout whole nights have been recommended for standardised acoustic monitoring but to date their cost has prohibited wide uptake. Here we describe an extensive survey approach in which members of the public borrowed detectors to participate in a large-scale monitoring and mapping project. Covering a 15% sample of the study area over two years, the survey generated over 600,000 bat recordings. We describe a semi-automated step-wise method for processing this large volume of recordings to assign identity to species or genus level with low error rates. Twelve species were recorded during the survey, ranging from the near ubiquitous Common Pipistrelle Pipistrellus pipistrellus to the locally scarce Leisler's bat Nyctalus leisleri. We show pronounced patterns of seasonality consistent with post-breeding dispersal and new information on nocturnal activity patterns. Using regression trees we generate new maps of standardised variation in activity which is likely to reflect underlying spatial variation in relative abundance. These reveal hitherto unknown patterns for species of superficially similar status. We conclude that with logistical support and centralised automated species identification it is now possible for the public to contribute to acoustic bat monitoring at an unprecedented scale.

abstract = {In order to ensure that the placement of future wind energy developments does not conflict with important areas for bats, surveys and analyses are required to deliver a robust understanding of large-scale patterns in species' distributions and abundance. We demonstrate that extensive presence-absence survey data can be collected for bats across a large (> 20,000 km(2)) region of southern Scotland using volunteers supplemented with additional fieldworker effort in remote areas. We advocate a survey design that allows data to be collected for all bat species, but provide more focused analyses on three species (Leisler's bat, noctule and Nathusius' pipistrelle) that are currently considered to be at highest risk from wind turbines. We estimate that between 16% and 24% of the regional populations of these three high risk species overlap existing and approved wind farms, with 50% of this overlap concentrated at just 10% of wind farms. This emphasises the importance of new wind farm placement to minimise impact on these species. We have stratified the region according to the potential impact on bats of future wind farm development, highlighting those areas in the top 1%, 5% and 10% of risk. We conclude that there is a need for higher quality data of this type in order to inform spatial models of bat distribution and activity. As a minimum standard, researchers working on bats should prioritise the collection and use of presence-absence data with consideration of the underlying survey design and representativeness of the data collected. This can be achieved most cost-effectively by working with the public to develop large-scale acoustic monitoring schemes.},

abstract = {1. There is increasing evidence from local studies carried out in several parts of the world to suggest that increases in the abundance of deer may be depressing population levels of breeding woodland bird populations that are associated with dense understorey habitats. We examine whether habitat modification by deer is likely to be a factor contributing to recent large-scale population declines of woodland birds in lowland England. 2. Novel analytical methods are applied to extensive national bird and deer monitoring data, to examine whether populations of 11 woodland bird species that are associated with dense understorey habitats in lowland England may have been depressed following increases in the abundance of three widespread and abundant deer species: Reeves' muntjac Muntiacus reevesi, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and fallow deer Dama dama. An additional four woodland bird species that are not specifically associated with understorey habitats are included as controls. 3. For five of the 11 understorey species considered, there is evidence that increases in deer are associated with large-scale depression of abundance or population declines in lowland England. Of these species, we suggest that the impacts of deer are likely to have been greatest for two species of conservation concern, common nightingale Luscinia megarhynchos and willow tit Poecile montanus. 4. Synthesis and applications. Large-scale analyses of extensive national monitoring data provide evidence for a negative association between three widespread and abundant deer species and several woodland bird populations that are associated with dense understorey habitats. These findings are consistent with those from small-scale experimental studies and indicate that deer-related habitat modification may be affecting some bird species on far larger scales than previously appreciated. Mainly through their effects on understorey vegetation, high deer populations are now likely to be affecting woodland biodiversity over large parts of lowland England and deer management plans, involving integrated exclusion and culling of deer, need to be co-ordinated on large scales. It is suggested that such management plans could most usefully target areas that still support relatively high populations of species that are sensitive to deer. Knowledge about the form of relationships between deer abundance and habitat quality for birds and other biodiversity is an important knowledge gap that needs to be addressed if sound, collaborative deer management plans are to be developed.},

abstract = {Several woodland bird species have declined markedly in abundance in England over the past 40 years, whilst the grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis, a non-native nest predator, has increased. Given the timing, there has been concern that grey squirrels have driven these declines, although there is little data to support this view. Using novel analytical methods and extensive national bird and grey squirrel monitoring data, we examine whether there is evidence that woodland bird populations in England have been depressed by grey squirrels and whether there is a relationship between nest failure and squirrel numbers. Our results indicate that grey squirrels are very unlikely to have driven observed declines of woodland birds in recent years, although the number of associations, positive as well as negative, between grey squirrels and woodland birds is greater than expected by chance. For this reason, we cannot exclude the possibility that the populations of a small number of bird species, principally increasing species, have been depressed to some degree at sites where a greater number of grey squirrels were present. Of these species, perhaps the most convincing evidence is for Common Blackbird Turdus merula and Eurasian Collared Dove Streptopelia decaocto where nest record data also identified a positive relationship between nest failure at the egg stage and squirrel abundance.},

journal = {Mammal Review},
volume = {37},
number = {1},
pages = {54-70},
abstract = {1. Environmental heterogeneity is important in determining the distribution and abundance of organisms at various spatial scales. The ability to understand and predict distribution patterns is important for solving many management problems in conservation biology and wildlife epidemiology. 2. The badger Meles meles is a highly adaptable, medium-sized carnivore, distributed throughout temperate Eurasia, which shows a wide diversity of social and spatial organization. Within Britain, badgers are not only legally protected, but they also serve as a wildlife host for bovine tuberculosis Mycobacterium bovis. An evaluation of the role of badgers in the dynamics of this infection depends on understanding the responses of badgers to the environment at different spatial scales. 3. The use of digital data to provide information on habitats for distribution models is becoming common. Digital data are increasingly accessible and are generally cheaper than field surveys. There has been little research, however, to compare the accuracy of models based on field-derived and remotely derived data. 4. In this paper, we make quantified comparisons between large-scale presence/absence models for badgers in Britain, based on field-surveyed habitat data and remotely derived digital data, comprising elevation, geology and soil. 5. We developed four models: 1980s badger survey data using field-based and digital data, and 1990s badger survey data using field-based and digital data. We divided each of the four datasets into two subsets and used one subset for training (developing) the model and the other for testing it. 6. All four training models had classification accuracies in excess of 69%. The models generated from digital data were slightly more accurate than those generated from field-derived habitat data. 7. The high classificatory ability of the digital-based models suggests that the use of digital data may overcome many of the problems associated with field data in wildlife-habitat modelling, such as cost and restricted geographical coverage, without any significant impact on model performance for some species. The more widespread use of digital data in wildlife-habitat models should enhance their accuracy, repeatability and applicability and make them better-suited as tools to aid policy- and decision-making processes.},

The frequency of roost switching varied with reproductive status, and was lowest in lactating females and highest in non-reproductive females, which changed roosts on average once every 5.0 and 1.5 days, respectively. Although Daubenton's bats regularly switched roosts, strong faithfulness to the roosting area was apparent regardless of whether they formed maternity colonies in trees or buildings. Although most roosts found at both study areas were in trees, lactating females and juveniles in one valley roosted only in trees whereas in the other they roosted exclusively in buildings, in which ambient temperatures were significantly higher. The implications of roosting habits for the transmission of European bat lyssavirus are discussed.},

abstract = {The extent of spatial partitioning in insectivorous bats, whose prey is patchily distributed and transient in nature, remains a contentious issue. The recent separation of a common Palaearctic bat, the pipistrelle, into Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus, which are morphologically similar and sympatric, provides an opportunity to examine this question. The present study used radio telemetry to address the spatial distribution and foraging characteristics of P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus in northeast Scotland, to test the hypothesis that coexistence between these species is facilitated through spatial segregation. We reveal large and significant differences in the spatial distribution and foraging characteristics of these two cryptic species. Individual P. pipistrellus home ranges were on average three times as large as that of P. pygmaeus, and they foraged for approximately an hour longer each night. Inter-specific spatial overlap was minimal (< 5%) and core foraging areas of either species were essentially mutually exclusive despite the proximity of the two roosts. Inter-specific differences in range size were associated with the spatial dispersion of productive foraging sites within individual foraging ranges. P. pipistrellus foraging sites were highly dispersed, necessitating larger ranges. It is predicted that the spatial segregation revealed by the present study is a result of selection favouring the avoidance of competition in these species through differential habitat use.},

However, the diversification of echolocation call structure in bats allows for considerable morphological similarity while still permitting niche differentiation based on specialisation for prey type and habitat structure. The recent separation of a common Palaearctic bat, the pipistrelle, into Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus, which are sympatrically distributed throughout their range, raises the question as to whether these two morphologically similar species partition resources in time and space. To test the hypothesis that the coexistence of these cryptic species is facilitated by differential habitat use, 14 P. pipistrellus, and 12 P. pygmaeus were radio-tracked from adjacent maternity roosts, in northeast Scotland, from May to September 2002/2003. The two species showed distinct habitat partitioning with P. pygmaeus foraging predominantly in riparian woodland and over water, and P. pipistrellus foraging along woodland edges and short isolated tree lines. Inter-specific overlap in habitat use was low and consequently foraging ranges were segregated spatially. The degree of habitat partitioning revealed in these species, which show considerable overlap in echolocation call parameters and functional morphology, suggests that morphological features, whilst useful in separating chiropteran species into coarse-grained foraging guilds, may not predict fine-grained ecological segregation.},

abstract = {1. Phenotypic plasticity and microevolution represent the two processes by which phenotypic traits in a population can track environmental change. While there is a growing literature documenting microevolution in reproductive traits in naturally occurring animal populations, few studies to date have examined either between-individual variation in levels of plasticity or how selection acts on plasticity. 2. We present here mixed-effect linear models analysing changes in calving date in relation to autumn rainfall observed over a 30-year study of 2147 red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland. The study period is characterized by a phase of low and rising population density (up to and including 1980), followed by a phase of high and fluctuating population density (1981 to present). 3. Variation within individual females explained a population-level trend of delayed calving dates following years of high autumn rainfall. There was significant variation between females both in their average calving dates and in their individual plastic responses of calving date to autumn rainfall. 4. Females born in the low population density phase were, on average, phenotypically plastic for the calving date-autumn rainfall relationship, and showed significant variation in plasticity. Selection favoured individuals with early average calving dates among these females. 5. Among females born at high population density, there was on average no significant plasticity for calving date, but variation in plastic responses was still present. Selection favoured females with increasingly positive plastic responses of calving date to autumn rainfall. 6. We argue that early experience of high population density affects the physiological condition of females, making an environmental response (calving early following dry autumns) in later life physiologically untenable for all but a few high quality individuals. These same few individuals also tend to be fitter and have higher reproductive success.},

abstract = {Introduced rat species have been implicated in the decline and local extirpation of numerous seabird species from islands across the globe, leading to widespread eradications as a conservation tool. However, little conclusive evidence has been established to determine the direct mechanisms in which rat and seabird species interact. This study aimed to quantify rates of egg predation by brown rats Rattus norvegicus using automated trail cameras at seabird nests baited with domestic quail and hen eggs to represent different-sized seabird eggs. The trail cameras were in situ for a total of 915 days during June and July 2011. Evidence for rats visiting the experimental nests was only observed at one location, where 19 visits were recorded, and no evidence of rat predation on hen or quail eggs was observed. Low levels of rat activity were observed during the study; therefore, it is not possible to conclude that rats never predate seabird eggs as predation may be more likely when rat densities are higher and pressure on food resources greater. This study does however highlight that where rats occur at low densities, predation of eggs is unlikely. Measures aimed at maintaining low abundance of rats in and around vulnerable seabird colonies may therefore be useful where complete eradication is not feasible, although potential for predation of chicks should also be considered.},

abstract = {We quantified the percentage cover of habitats and the extent of linear features within 2 km of 11 maternity roosts of the 55 kHz phonic type of pipistelles Pipistrellus pipistrellus in south-west England, and compared these with habitats around random points. The dominant habitats around both roosts and random points were improved grassland and built-up areas. There was significantly more water (especially water edge habitat with woodland or hedgerow on the banks), and continuous hedgerow with emergent trees, around roosts. Preference for freshwater habitats around roosts was shown in comparisons of single habitats, and in compositional analyses with and without the inclusion of urbanized random points. These habitats may be preferred by 55 kHz pipistrelles: riparian habitats support large numbers of flying insects of the types eaten by 55 kHz pipistrelles, and hedgerows may be important linear features used by bats. The conservation of continuous hedgerows and watercourses close to maternity roosts would appear to be very important for 55 kHz pipistrelles.},

abstract = {The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have become the target of choice for studies wishing to examine adaptively important genetic diversity in natural populations. Within Molecular Ecology alone, there have been 71 papers on aspects of MHC evolution over the past few years, with an increasing year on year trend. This focus on the MHC is partly driven by the hypothesized links between MHC gene dynamics and ecologically interesting and relevant traits, such as mate choice and host-parasite interactions. However, an ability to pin down the evolutionary causes and ecological consequences of MHC variation in natural populations has proven challenging and has been hampered by the very issue that is attractive about MHC genes - their high levels of diversity. Linking high levels of MHC diversity to ecological factors in inherently complex natural populations requires a level of experimental design and analytical rigour that is extremely difficult to achieve owing to a plethora of potentially confounding and interacting variables. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Smith et al. (2010) elegantly overcome the challenge of detecting complex interactions in complex systems by using an intricate analytical approach to demonstrate a role for MHC in the reproductive ability of a natural population of the European hare Lepus europaeus (Fig. 1). Also in this issue, Oppelt et al. (2010) demonstrate a role for MHC variation in determining levels of hepatic coccidian infection in the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus (Fig. 2).},

During the period separating the two surveys, 24 main setts and 11 outliers persisted without a change of status; 1 main sett became an outlier and 14 outliers became main setts; 32 main setts and 131 outliers appeared de novo; and 5 main setts and 10 outliers disappeared. Main setts that persisted grew in size at an average rate of about 0.5 entrances per year. Changes in the status of a sett were not related to its initial size or habitat characteristics, but habitat changes or human interference were implicated in all cases in which main setts disappeared. Total number of main setts increased from 30 to 70, average territory size decreased from 0.7 km(2) to 0.3 km(2) and the number of outliers per territory increased from 1.2 to 2.0. The results suggest that when a badger population expands, new main setts are sometimes formed from existing outliers but are more often constructed de novo. Sometimes a main sett commanding a large territory is replaced by several new main setts and the territory is subdivided; on other occasions the original main sett persists and its territory is compressed as new territories are established in the vicinity.},

abstract = {Postal questionnaires were distributed to farmers and gamekeepers within the Polecat's Mustela putorius main range in Britain. Only 11% of responding farmers had ever experienced damage by Polecats; 28% regarded the species as a threat to livestock. Conversely 53% of farmers believed Polecats control Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, and 39% believed they control rodents on the farm. Two-thirds of responding gamekeepers had experienced Polecat predation of penned game, with the commonest access routes via 'pop-holes' and beneath the perimeter wire. Most gamekeepers (68%) regarded the Polecat as a minor pest, but ranked it as a less serious threat to game than predators such as the Fox Vulpes vulpes, Feral Cat Felis catus, Stoat Mustela erminea, corvids and Mink Mustela vison. Majorities of both farmers and gamekeepers would be concerned about an increase in the numbers of Polecats, and most wished to be free to control the species. Trapping was regarded as the main defence against Polecat predation of game; 91% of gamekeepers had trapped Polecats over the preceding 5 years. A minority of farmers carried out Polecat control; this activity was more prevalent on farms near the fringe of the species' range. Pest-control practices likely to impact accidentally or indirectly upon Polecats, such as rodenticide use, fumigation ('gassing') of Rabbit burrows and ferreting, were also more prevalent on farms towards the fringe of the species' range. These findings are discussed in the light of the Polecat's status as a Scheduled species recovering its range in Britain. In anticipation of the species' further spread into areas where game shooting is prevalent, recommendations are made regarding the need to improve game husbandry and to modify trapping practice. In particular, the night-time closure of pop-holes and the effective exclusion of Polecats from tunnel traps are suggested as a means of promoting greater tolerance of Polecats and compliance with the law.},

abstract = {The British Government's contingency plan for the control of wildlife rabies is based on oral vaccination around a focal outbreak, with the option of the targeted lethal control of foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and badgers (Meles meles) using buried poisoned bait. We investigated uptake by badgers of nonpoison meat-based baits buried along transects for 10 consecutive days in 1995. The original aim was to evaluate the likely effectiveness of this contingency option. However, the results are also pertinent to the development of an oral tuberculosis (TB) vaccine baiting strategy for badgers, for which research has primarily been carried out since this study was completed. Bait disappearance steadily increased over time, reaching an asymptote after 7 days. By incorporating iophenoxic acid biomarkers into baits, we showed that about 51% of subsequently captured badgers had consumed bait, the majority of which did so during the first 7 days. Bait uptake was significantly higher among adults. Rates of uptake by badgers of baits buried along transects could be increased by shortening the prebaiting period or extending the baiting period. However, considerably higher levels of uptake by adults and cubs are likely to be achieved by targeting bait deployment at badger setts, and this is now included in Britain's rabies contingency plan. Although meat-based baits cannot be used for TB control, the relevance of these results to the delivery of an oral TB vaccine bait to badgers is discussed. (C) 2012 Crown copyright},

abstract = {Badgers are carnivores that show considerable variation in their social and spatial organization. At the westernmost part of their range, in Britain and Ireland, variation in spatial organization appears to be determined by the availability of resources. However, the majority of studies has focussed at one end of the social/spatial spectrum, where population densities are high and adjacent territories are contiguous and non-overlapping. To examine whether the same limiting factors appear to apply across a wider range of badger densities, we established a study site in a predominantly coniferous habitat within an upland area of northeast England, where population densities were predicted to be low. Seasonal home ranges of individual badgers were largest in autumn, followed by summer and spring, then winter. This pattern is reflective of the likely seasonal changes in food availability within the area, as opposed to being related to breeding patterns. There were also significant correlations between territory size and the number of grassland patches (positive) and the proportion of grassland (negative), which are consistent with predictions from the Resource Dispersion Hypothesis. Although badgers at the site were living at low to moderate densities relative to many other studied populations in Britain, they showed patterns of spatial organization that were close to those of high-density populations. The nature of the relationship between resource availability and abundance patterns is likely to have important consequences for the conservation and management of badgers and other species that show flexible spatial organization.},

To investigate the presence of rHEV in wild rabbit population, serum and tissue samples were taken from 65 rabbits, 35 Italian and 30 from UK. Sera were submitted to a double antigen sandwich ELISA, whereas hepatic tissues and other organs to molecular and pathological investigations. Sixteen serum samples (24.6%) scored positive for anti-HEV antibodies, and six samples (9%) of hepatic tissue were positive for HEV RT-PCR, while the other organs were negative. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of HEV RNA-positive samples indicated that while two Italian rabbits were infected with strains closely related to wild boar and swine strains (HEV-3), the other four (2 Italian and 2 English) were clustered within rHEV clade. Megalocytosis and multifocal areas of hepatocytes degeneration and necrosis with a pericentrilobular pattern were observed in rHEV-infected rabbits. In those infected by the strain analogous to HEV-3, the lesions were mainly localized in the periportal areas and were less severe. In both cases, inflammatory infiltrates were predominantly composed of CD3-positive lymphocytes and a reduced number of macrophages. By immunohistochemistry, only liver samples taken from HEV RNA-positive rabbits scored positive for viral antigen. Our results indicated that HEV infection is present in rabbit population with different clades and is endemic in the Italian and English wild rabbit population, suggesting the possibility that this species may be infected with rHEV or swine HEV-3 strains.},

These two phonic types occur in sympatry over much of Britain. Between 1993 and 1995 mating groups of P. pipistrellus were located in bat boxes between August and October, the main mating period for these bats. Mating groups comprised a single male and up to three females. Broadband, time-expanded recordings of search-phase echolocation calls were made from bats immediately after release. The average FMAXE of each bat was calculated: bats with an FMAXE less than 49 kHz were classed as 45 kHz phonic types and bats with an FMAXE greater than 52 kHz were classed as 55 kHz phonic types. A total of 16, 45 kHz groups and ten 55 kHz groups were located. No mating group ever contained more than one phonic type, although both types were known to be present at several of the study sites. Males emitted calls of higher frequency than females for both phonic types. The study suggests that the two phonic types are reproductively isolated and supports the hypothesis that P. pipistrellus should be considered as two cryptic sibling species.},

abstract = {Sewage treatment works (STWs) with percolating filter beds are known to provide profitable foraging areas for insectivorous birds because of their association with high macroinvertebrate densities. Fly larvae developing on filter beds at STWs may similarly provide a valuable resource for foraging bats. Over the last two decades, however, there has been a decline in filter beds towards a system of 'activated sludge'. Insects and bat activity were surveyed at 30 sites in Scotland using these two different types of sewage treatment in order to assess the possible implications of these changes for foraging bats. Bat activity (number of passes) recorded from broad-band bat detectors was quantified at three points within each site. The biomass of aerial insects, sampled over the same period as the detector surveys, was measured using a suction trap. The biomass of insects and activity of Pipistrellus spp. were significantly higher at filter beds than at activated sludge sites. In addition, although foraging activity of Pipistrellus spp. at filter beds was comparable to that of adjacent 'good' foraging habitat, foraging at activated sludge sites was considerably lower. This study indicates the high potential value of an anthropogenic process to foraging bats, particularly in a landscape where their insect prey has undergone a marked decline, and suggests that the current preference for activated sludge systems is likely to reduce the value of treatment works as foraging sites for bats.},

abstract = {Activity patterns of greater horseshoe bats Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were investigated at caves in Cheddar (south-west England) during the hibernation season. An ultrasound detector and datalogger were used to monitor and record the number of echolocation calls in a single cave. Activity of R. ferrumequinum remained largely nocturnal throughout winter, and the mean time of activity over 24 h was 88 to 369 min after sunset. There was an increase in diurnal activity from late May to early June, probably because bats remained active after foraging at dawn towards the end of the hibernation season. Visits to the cave did not increase bat activity. Cave air temperature reflected external climatic temperature, although there was variation in cave temperature and its range within and among caves. Individual R. ferrumequinum are usually dispersed in caves in regions where temperature fluctuations correlate with climatic variations in temperature. There was a positive correlation between the number of daily bat passes monitored by the bat detector and datalogger (= daily activity) and cave temperature. Nocturnal activity may be sometimes associated with winter feeding. Neither date nor barometric pressure had a significant effect on daily activity. Activity patterns largely reflected the findings from individual R. ferrumequinum studied by telemetry (Park, 1998), in that bat activity increased with cave and climatic temperatures, and the temporal pattern of activity remained consistently nocturnal throughout winter, starting at dusk.},

abstract = {1. Patterns of torpor, arousal and activity in free-living Greater Horseshoe Bats, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (Schreber), were investigated during the hibernation period by using temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters. 2. Torpor bouts varied between 0.1 and 11.8 days, with individual means ranging from 1.3 to 7.4 days. Torpor bout duration decreased with increasing ambient temperature. 3. Activity duration varied from 37 min to 54 h 24 min, with individual means ranging from 2 : 29 to 8 : 58 h. Activity duration increased with ambient temperatures above approximately 10 degreesC. 4. Ten of 11 bats synchronized their arousals with dusk. The circadian rhythm of one bat showed a free-running pattern over a period of about 5 weeks. Arousals were more highly synchronized, and closer to dusk, in individuals with lower body condition. 5. That bats forage in mild weather is supported by the strong synchronization of arousals with dusk, especially in bats with low body condition. 6. Patterns of torpor and subsequent activity are consistent with predictions that torpor lasts until a critical metabolic or water imbalance is achieved. Because metabolism and water loss are temperature-dependent, torpor bout duration decreases with increasing temperature. The imbalance is corrected during subsequent activity, which is relatively constant in duration until a temperature threshold of 10 degreesC, above which increasing levels of foraging lead to longer activity bouts.},

abstract = {The social structure of three sympatric bat species occupying bat boxes in woodland in southern England was studied: Pipistrellus pipistrellus (pipistrelle), Plecotus auritus (brown long-eared bat) and Myotis nattereri (Natterer's bat). Before parturition, P. pipistrellus populations were heavily skewed towards solitary males. After parturition, the sex ratio was closer to unity. Recaptures of marked bats suggested that after parturition a resident male population of P. pipistrellus is invaded by a transient female population. The sex ratios of populations of P. auritus and M. nattereri were very close to unity, both pre- and post-parturition. The numbers of recaptures of individual bats were similar for both sexes in P. auritus and slightly higher for females in M. nattereri. In the mating season (August-October), solitary male P. pipistrellus were found with small groups (1-9) of females. In contrast, in both P. auritus and M. nattereri, mixed sex groups were found pre-and post-parturition, and roosting groups in the mating season contained up to 20 females and up to 10 males. The stability of female groups in P. auritus appeared to be higher than M. nattereri and P. pipistrellus as known females were found together more frequently. These patterns are discussed with reference to the possible differences in foraging and social behaviour.},

abstract = {A hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) survey was conducted in four regions of west and south-west England during the summer of 2006. In each region, surveys were conducted in a series of 15-18 survey areas each of which contained 1-4 paired amenity grassland (recreation ground, sports field, and village green) and permanent pasture survey sites. Each pair of survey sites was surveyed for hedgehogs using night-time lamped searches during two separate survey periods. Located hedgehogs were sexed, weighed, and aged. The density of hedgehogs on individual sites was based on the maximum number of hedgehogs recorded during any one of the two surveys. The occurrence of hedgehogs on pasture (2 % of fields) was much lower than that on amenity grassland (26 % of fields), resulting in mean densities of hedgehogs that were significantly greater on amenity grassland than on pasture in all four regions. The density of hedgehogs was 0.47 +/- 0.09 ha(-1) on amenity grassland and 0.04 +/- 0.02 ha(-1) on pasture (mean +/- standard error). This study represents a geographically extensive and locally intensive hedgehog field survey in England and produces results that are spatially and temporally concurrent with wildlife surveys of another ecologically linked species, the badger (Meles meles).},

journal = {Ecological Informatics},
volume = {14},
pages = {64-70},
abstract = {Assessing and monitoring populations of elusive species frequently rely on the identification of indirect signs such as faeces. The absence of signs does not necessarily denote the absence of a species, thus, the ability to determine the presence/absence is susceptible to false negative results. The probability of detection is central to the interpretation and utility of data from field sign surveys. A low probability of detection may introduce considerable error into distribution patterns, resulting in inaccurate ecological conclusions. We used a systematic resampling approach, based on sequential spatial replication of spraint surveys, to investigate the probability of detecting Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra L) with different survey designs. This included the standard otter transect survey methodology, which is widely used in conservation and scientific studies. In particular, we focus on the impact of applying broad scale population assessment techniques at smaller spatial scales. Fortnightly catchment-level otter surveys were undertaken on four lowland rivers in South Wales, over a period of two years. GIS was used to construct binary vectors for each survey, denoting the presence (1) or absence (0) of otters at each 50 m section of river. Vectors from all study rivers were pooled and resampled to test the different survey designs. The mean probability of detecting otters based on the standard protocol of a single 600 m transect survey was very low (0.26 +/- 0.01 SE). The best way of obtaining a detection probability of 0.8 was to undertake three repeat surveys at two separate sites, using a transect of 800-1000 m. We demonstrate how sequentially collected spatial data can be analysed to determine the reliability of field sign surveys. Increasing the number of visits and study sites was a more efficient means of improving detection power than increasing transect length alone. The study emphasises the importance of determining detection probabilities and designing field sign surveys according to study scale and objectives. Our findings question the value of survey designs that aim to provide an instantaneous assessment of species presence/absence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

pages = {485-494},
abstract = {The importance of the marine environment to Eurasian otters is currently poorly understood. Wales is one of the few countries where coastal activity has been recorded and an increase in marine otter sightings could indicate remarkable developments within Welsh populations. The trophic niche of coastal otter populations around Pembrokeshire was investigated over a 12-month period. Marine activity was more widespread than previously thought and marine prey formed the largest component of otter diet, although, otters also consumed freshwater and terrestrial prey throughout the year. Otter diet was very diverse compared to other European coastal populations and a spring contraction in trophic niche width coincided with the estimated timing of breeding activity. Seasonal variation in prey composition was predominantly due to differences in the consumption of alternate prey types. In areas where wetlands are fragmented and populations of freshwater fish are declining, the marine environment may become an increasingly important habitat for otters. It is necessary to define the historical importance of coastal populations to otter conservation. Coastal areas are often subject to pressure from human activities, so the impact of disturbance needs to be assessed. Importantly, there is no verified otter survey method for coastal areas, so the use of marine habitat is likely to be underestimated.},

abstract = {We radio-tracked 24 Myotis daubentonii and 35 Myotis nattereri during the swarming season to determine the catchment area of a swarming site and to study habitat preferences of the bats so that important foraging habitats within the catchment area could be identified. Sixty-one percent of individuals were relocated and 39 day roosts were found for 31 bats. Maximum range from the swarming site was 26.7 km for M. daubentonii and 24.8 km for M. nattereri. Minimum convex polygons depicting the minimum catchment area of the swarming site measured 254 km(2) for M. daubentonii and 497 km(2) for M. nattereri. Including recoveries of ringed bats increases the area enclosed by the maximum range to at least 4118 km(2). Compositional analysis of habitat used in relation to that available suggested selection of mixed agricultural areas by M. nattereri. Broad-leaved woodland was preferred for foraging. Parkland, woodland and open-water habitats were common around roosts of M. daubentonii. Such habitats should be conserved and enhanced to protect these species. Some individuals of both sexes returned to the swarming site of capture, but none visited another swarming site. Bats may be faithful to only one site and may be inflexible should that site be destroyed. Because the catchment area of swarming sites is large, such sites are probably important centres of outbreeding. Protection of these mating sites should be a conservation priority, and key habitats should be protected over a large area around swarming sites.},

abstract = {Several species of vespertilionid bat gather at underground sites in temperate zones during late summer and early autumn for an activity called swarming. Up to many hundreds of bats may arrive and depart during a night. Bat activity was recorded automatically with a frequency division logging system at a swarming site in south-east England for 415 nights between 1997 and 2001. In all 5 years, activity was highest between the beginning of August and the end of October (the swarming period), with a peak in September. Activity varied markedly from night to night and was affected by rainfall (which significantly suppressed swarming activity), and residual maximum ambient temperature (with which activity was positively correlated). Moon phase had no detectable influence on swarming activity. Activity was low in the first few hours after sunset of each night during the swarming period indicating that few bats emerged and that there was low daytime occupancy of the site. Activity increased to a peak between 6 and 7 h post-sunset consistent with a large number of bats arriving after the first evening foraging bout. Activity then decreased gradually up to dawn as these bats departed again. Logged activity was positively correlated with the number of bats caught by harp-trap, confirming that loggers are a reliable alternative to catching when monitoring a swarming site.},

The land area covered by returned questionnaires was 71098km2 (90% of Scotland). Mountain hares were reported as present on 34359km2 (48%) and absent from 36739km2 (52%). Mountain hare presence was strongly associated with heather moorland managed for red grouse shooting. Moorland managed for driven grouse shooting had the highest percentage area of mountain hare presence (median 64%) followed by moorland managed for walked-up grouse shooting (median 9%) and moorland with no grouse shooting (median 0%). Approximately 25000 mountain hares were harvested in 2006-07. Based on the estimated UK population in 1995 of 350000 (range +/- 50%), this represents around 7% of the population (range 5-14%). Reasons given by respondents for harvesting hares were tick control (50%), sport (40%) and forestry or crop protection (10%). Comparison of the estates surveyed in both 2006-07 and 1995-96 (a total area of 20462km2) indicated no net gain or loss in hare distribution. Furthermore, there was no evidence that levels of harvest had reduced the range of mountain hares in this area. It is not possible to comment on any distribution change outside this area (58737km2). Similarly, as no data were collected on abundance, it is not possible to draw conclusions on changes in density. Regular monitoring of mountain hare distribution within Scotland is required to identify any distribution changes. Measures of abundance throughout the range are necessary to estimate the population size, investigate the relationship between harvest intensity and changes in abundance and further assess the conservation status of this UK Biodiversity Action Plan species.},

abstract = {Green roofs, (roofs that are deliberately vegetated), are a technology that seeks to lessen the impacts of urbanisation on people and wildlife. This study investigates their value for UK bat species within the context of the built environment. Green roofs were categorised as 'sedum' or 'biodiverse' according to their dominant vegetation type. Bat activity was monitored over 13 biodiverse, nine sedum and 17 conventional un-vegetated roofs located within the Greater London area for seven nights using Anabat SD1 detectors. Influence of roof type and environmental variables on bat activity were evaluated using generalised linear models. Pipistrellus pipistrellus were most frequently recorded followed by Pipistrellus pygmaeus, Nyctalus/Eptesicus and Pipistrellus nathusii. The mean number of call sequences per night was 5.2. Feeding events accounted for 16% (217) of call sequences. Bat activity was significantly higher over biodiverse roofs compared to conventional roofs. A greater extent of suitable habitat within the surrounding area had a positive influence on bat activity but numbers of call sequences and feeding events were significantly higher over biodiverse roofs compared to conventional roofs when suitable habitat within a 100 metre radius of the roof was below 33% cover. Other factors affecting bat activity included roof height (negative influence with increased height) and the month of survey. No significant differences were found between sedum and conventional roofs. The findings suggest that biodiverse roofs offer enhanced habitat for bats within the context of urbanised environments. Further studies are needed to predict more accurately their value as a bat conservation measure.},

abstract = {The loss of tooth effectiveness due to molar wear has been proposed as an important cause of mortality in ungulate populations. Voluntary intakes, digestibility, mean retention times, chewing behaviour (during eating and rumination), and diet selection (physical selection: short vs long particles in hay; and botanical selection: leaf is stem) were compared in two groups of female red deer (Cervus elaphus) which differed in molar occlusal surface area, in order to test the hypothesis that behavioural and physiological mechanisms can be used to maintain assimilation efficiency in the presence of low functional tooth effectiveness. The group with lower values for first lower molar occlusal surface area (OSA) corrected for body weight had lower voluntary food intakes (P = 0.0126). The low OSA group had a greater number of chews per g DM of food ingested (P = 0.0167), a greater time spent chewing (P = 0.0476) but a lower number of chews per min than did those with a high OSA (P = 0.0484). The total number of chews per day was similar for both groups (P = 0.2011). The number of ruminating chews per day was less for the low OSA group (P = 0.0377). The group with low OSA values had a larger average particle size in their faeces (P = 0.0346). No differences were detected between groups in the physical or botanical composition of the diet selected (P = 0.3030, P = 0.3056, respectively) or in total digestibility and mean retention times (P = 0.1357, P = 0.3464, respectively). As a consequence of the lower voluntary intake the low OSA group had a lower digestible dry matter intake (P = 0.0170). This study supports the view that intake modification and the time invested in chewing during eating are the main mechanisms used to compensate for reduced chewing effectiveness associated with changes in tooth morphology, although the compensation is not total.},

abstract = {Understanding how habitat selection changes with population density is a key concept in population regulation, community composition and managing impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. At low density, it is expected that individuals select habitats in terms of their preference, but as population density increases, the availability of resources per individual declines on preferred habitats, leading to competition which forces some individuals to exploit less preferred habitats. Using spatial information of Scottish red deer (Cervus elaphus) winter counts, carried out in 110 areas across Scotland between 1961 and 2004 (a total of 1,206,495 deer observations), we showed how winter habitat niche breadth in red deer has widened with increasing population density. Heather moorland and montane habitats were most and least preferred for deer, respectively. Increasing density favoured the selection of grassland, to the detriment of the selection of heather moorland. The selection of heather and grassland decreased when temperature increased, while the selection of montane and peatland habitats increased. These findings are important for understanding how habitat use, density and population are likely to be affected by weather, and allow us to predict habitat impacts by large mammal herbivory and climate.},

abstract = {Control and mitigation of disease in wild ungulate populations are one of the major challenges in wildlife management. Despite the importance of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes for immune response, assessment of diversity on these genes is still rare for European deer populations. Here, we conducted the first assessment of variation at the second exon of the MHC DRB in wild populations of Scottish highland red deer, the largest continuous population of red deer in Europe. Allelic diversity at these loci was high, with 25 alleles identified. Selection analyses indicated c. 22% of amino acids encoded under episodic positive selection. Patterns of MHC allelic distribution were not congruent with neutral population genetic structure (estimated with 16 nuclear microsatellite markers) in the study area, the latter showing a marked differentiation between populations located at either side of the Great Glen. This study represents a first step towards building an immunogenetic map of red deer populations across Scotland to aid future management strategies for this ecologically and economically important species.},

abstract = {The red deer (Cervus elaphus) is one of the most widely distributed species of deer in Europe. Due to its economic value as game species or its negative impacts on forestry, agriculture and conservation areas, most populations are currently managed, with strategies and intensity of the management varying between countries. In Britain, and less certainly in Ireland, red deer have been continuously present since the end of the last glaciation and constitute the largest population of red deer in Europe. Although they thrived in the past when forests were abundant, the current distribution of red deer in the British Isles is uneven, with the largest numbers being found in Scotland and few and more localised populations in England, Wales and the Republic of Ireland. In the British Isles, Lis in many other parts of Europe, there is a long history of man interacting with deer populations including local extinctions, multiple translocations and introductions of exotic species of deer. Among introduced exotic species of deer, the Japanese sika (Cervus nippon) is the one of most concern. After introduction of small numbers at multiple locations in Britain and Ireland from 1860 onwards, sika have increased in population number and range in areas with good forest cover, and where they overlap with red deer there is a risk of hybridisation. Due to recent increases in numbers and range of red and sika deer, both species pose a range of management challenges which are not easy to solve. In this review we summarise the history and status of these two species in Great Britain and Ireland, describe current management and discuss management options for the future.

abstract = {In recent decades in the UK, there has been an increasing trend in numbers of the European wild rabbit, a significant agricultural pest typically associated with grassland habitats. However, the relationship between rabbit abundance and grassland management, in particular grazing, has not been sufficiently explained. We studied rabbit densities in seven pasture-dominated sites in north-east England between autumn and spring in two consecutive years, and used generalised linear mixed models and generalised additive models to explore relationships between habitat and management variables and rabbit abundance at local (field) and landscape scales. At the local scale high rabbit densities were significantly associated with small fields and the very short, homogeneous swards created by intensive sheep grazing during autumn and winter. At the landscape scale, high rabbit numbers were associated with sites with most field margins and a predator removal policy. Our results indicate that landscape management may play a central role in explaining rabbit abundance and distribution in grasslands. We suggest that current pasture management may create favourable conditions for high rabbit densities, and consequently boost numbers of this significant pest species.},

abstract = {Biomass energy crops are prompting major land-use changes in agricultural and marginal land in an effort to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Miscanthus x giganteus, a perennial giant grass, is one of the main such crops in Europe but few studies exist of its interaction with farmland wildlife, particularly mammals. Understanding ecological impacts of bioenergy planting schemes is vital for mitigating potential negative effects on already declining farmland biodiversity and for maximising any benefits fromthese low-management, structurally diverse crops. We assessed in a mixed farming area in the UK the impact of Miscanthus crops on the brown hare (Lepus europaeus), a widespread but declining farmland species of conservation concern. We intensively radio-tracked hares in Miscanthus blocks of contrasting size and analysed hare diet for evidence of the consumption of Miscanthus. Home ranges differed starkly averaging 10.5 versus 49.6 ha in the small and the large Miscanthus blocks, respectively. Despite entirely avoiding the crop as food, hares appeared able to exist and even thrive in areas planted with Miscanthus though their populations may be significantly limited by reduced food availability and increased energy use where dense Miscanthus is planted over a wide area. As a component of a mixed farming landscape, Miscanthus may provide biodiversity benefits by increasing spatial heterogeneity and refuge areas for declining farmland species like brown hares but any effect is likely to be strongly scale-dependant.},

Hares selected agri-environment field margins during both active and inactive periods and used the areas in the middle of large fields less frequently than those closer to the field boundaries. Blocks of woods and lines of trees were selected as resting sites while sheep-grazed fields were generally avoided throughout the year.

We investigated six maternity colonies of pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus and R pygmaeus) in NE Scotland and recorded light levels and time of emergence and return of the bats with respect to sunset and sunrise on the same nights. Parameters of return activity generally occurred at lower light intensities than those of emergence. Therefore, the interval between dawn return and sunrise was generally longer than that between sunset and dusk emergence. Emergence and return were equal in duration. Bats clustered more on emergence in comparison with return during pregnancy and lactation, whereas during postlactation this trend was reversed.},

journal = {European Journal of Wildlife Research},
volume = {63},
number = {3},
pages = {12},
abstract = {Although residential areas are often unfavourable for wildlife, some species can take advantage of the available shelter and anthropogenic sources of food such as supplementary feeding. The European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) is increasingly associated with gardens and villages and less so with arable farmland. Suggested drivers for this include the following: hedgehogs' attraction to higher food densities, including natural prey and anthropogenic sources, a greater range of day nest sites and warmer microclimates in rural villages, coupled with decreased risk of predation by badgers (Meles meles). We investigated the contribution of these drivers by radio-tracking hedgehogs on four arable sites, two with badgers present. Seventy-eight hedgehogs were tracked, 32 yielding enough data to calculate home range sizes. At the home range and landscape scales, gardens and buildings were the highest ranked habitats compared with their availability. Woodland and arable land were the lowest ranked compared with their availability. Villages were the most selected habitat for nesting. When hedgehogs were found closer to buildings, their ranges were smaller and we speculate this is due to increased food availability in villages. Where badgers were present hedgehogs remained closer to cover and their home ranges were on average 12.2 ha smaller. On badger-occupied sites, 50% fewer radio-tracking fixes were on arable land. We conclude that resource availability coupled with nest site selection and badger presence drives hedgehogs' selection of rural villages. We found no effect of ambient temperature on habitat use. We recommend focusing conservation efforts on maintaining hedgehog populations in rural villages.},

journal = {Journal of Applied Ecology},
volume = {37},
pages = {136-147},
abstract = {1. The regional synchrony hypothesis (RSH) states that synchrony in microtine abundance over large geographical areas is caused by nomadic avian predators that specialize on small mammals for food. This has proved a difficult hypothesis to test because experiments at an appropriate scale are almost impossible. 2. We used the decline of the most abundant, nomadic vole-eating raptors in an extensive conifer forest in northern England (Kielder Forest) as a natural experiment to evaluate their influence on synchronizing voles at different spatial scales. Field vole populations fluctuated on a 3-4-year cycle of abundance, similar to the periodicity in central Fennoscandia. 3. Over a 23-year period, the combined numbers and density of kestrels and short-eared owls significantly declined. If these raptors were responsible for synchronizing vole abundance, the decline should have been associated with a decrease in synchrony. We could find no change in synchrony during the period of the greatest decline in kestrel and short-eared owl numbers (1980-97). 4. In Kielder, vole abundance has been shown to change in a wave-like manner, with synchrony in the direction of the wave being 5-10-fold smaller than that reported in Fennoscandia. Tawny owls are sedentary and the most abundant vole-eating raptor in our study area, and might have an equalizing influence on vole abundance over smaller areas if they foraged in a density-dependent manner and responded functionally to increasing vole density. If this was the case, spatial variability in vole density should have been less in occupied than unoccupied owl territories, especially in years of low vole density when owls could take a larger proportion of the standing crop of voles. Even though tawny owls caught a significant proportion of the vole population, we could find no difference in variation in vole density between owl territories that were unoccupied, occupied with no breeding attempt, or occupied with a successful breeding attempt. 5. We conclude that the small-scale synchrony in field vole abundance is unlikely to be caused by avian predators. Instead, it is more likely to be related to the pattern of clear-cutting that has developed in Kielder, which restricts vole dispersal. If this assumption is correct, we would predict more widespread synchrony in vole abundance in first-generation forests when extensive areas are planted over short periods of time, and this is supported by anecdotal evidence. These conclusions indicate that foresters may be able to manipulate the spatial dynamics of voles and vole predators by varying patch sizes within forests.},

abstract = {Red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) have been lost from most broadleaved habitats in England due to the range expansion of grey squirrels (S. carolinensis). Currently, the main refugia for red squirrels in England are the extensive exotic conifer forests in the north. These forests are also home to an expanding population of northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) that were re-established in the 1970s. During the breeding season (March-August), goshawks feed mainly on birds, with species of Columbidae, Corvidae and Phasianidae/Tetraonidae comprising 79% of 5445 prey items collected during 1973-1996. Only 97 red squirrels were recorded in this sample. We estimated that ca. 79 red squirrels were removed by goshawks each breeding season in Kielder Forest, but there was much annual variation (8-261 squirrels predated) that appeared to be related to the masting frequency of Norway spruce (Picea abies). Goshawks were likely to remove fewer squirrels outside the breeding season (September-February) because only adult males overwintered in the study area. Based on the area of conifers of a cone-bearing age and known densities of squirrels, we estimated that 1294-5556 adult squirrels produced 2135-9167 offspring annually in Kielder. For goshawks to reduce the population growth rate of squirrels to zero, predation would have to exceed 50% of the population. Clearly, this does not appear to be the case. This conclusion is in broad agreement with other studies indicating that food availability (conifer seed) is the main factor limiting numbers of tree squirrels, not predation. Thus, existing conservation management for sympatric populations of red squirrels and goshawks are compatible. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Common shrews (Sorex araneus L.) were presented with two prey types at various densities in a depleting environment. Observed diet choice was compared to predictions of the classical optimal diet model and of ''shrew-specific'' simulations incorporating patch depletion. Two strategies were simulated: expansion of the diet from taking only profitable prey to taking both types, and fixed partial preference. The simulations predict partial preference over a narrow range of initial densities of profitable prey. However, within this range, energetic benefits are relatively insensitive to diet composition. Shrews preferred more profitable prey and were more selective when encounter rate with profitable prey was higher, broadly as predicted by all the models. Partial preference was observed, but neither of the mechanisms simulated was strongly supported by results for the shrews. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify cues involved in selecting prey. Instantaneous measures of encounter rates and encounters per unit search distance were the best predictors of subsequent prey choice, but decisions appear to have been made on a probabilistic basis.},

abstract = {Hair tubes are efficient for sampling shrews and potentially important for sampling Sorex minutus, which is poorly sampled with other methods such as live trapping. We tested the effect of aperture size, bait, and position and type of sticky strip in hair tubes on the detection of S. minutus hairs. The optimum S. minutus hair tube design has high specificity for S. minutus (hairs are 12 times more likely to be from S. rninutus than from other species), easily constructed and suitable for use in large-scale surveys. Between the end of July and middle of September 2008 we repeatedly surveyed 46 sites twice with a transect of 20 S. minutus hair tubes. Occupancy of S. minutus was higher in hedgerow sites (0.92) than grassland (0.59) and woodland sites (0.42). Relative activity-density was estimated from models allowing abundance-induced heterogeneity in detection probability and was also higher in hedgerow sites (1.75) than grassland (1.23) and woodland sites (0.72). Relative activity-density is a function of abundance and movement and hence should be interpreted with caution but is a valuable parameter to estimate from data on presence or absence of a species at a site. From our data we recommend that surveys are carried before the end of August, in which case three surveys per site at up to 120 sites per habitat (depending on habitat and start date) are necessary to obtain precise estimates of site occupancy. Site occupancy should be quantified as a relevant parameter alongside abundance when conducting indirect surveys of mammals and relative activity-density should also be considered.

We present a new design of hair tube and a new, simple method of species identification from multivariate analysis of four parameters measured from shrew guard hairs using a binocular microscope with incident light. 2. Multivariate analysis of these parameters measured from hairs of known identity showed that they can be used to identify hair to the species level with 85% accuracy. 3. We compared our indices of abundance from hair tubes (the hair tube index) with those from live trapping in 40 field margins. Capture-mark-recapture methods showed that capture rate did not vary systematically across sites, so that number of individuals captured was used as an index of abundance. 4. The hair tube index showed a significant association with the number of individuals captured for Sorex araneus and Neomys fodiens. The lack of a significant association for Sorex minutus may be because hair tubes are more sensitive in detecting this species than live trapping. 5. Hair tubes have additional advantages over live trapping, since they do not require frequent checking, are much lighter and cheaper than live traps, and no licence is required for their use in the UK. We therefore recommend consideration of their use in future surveys and monitoring studies of shrews. We provide an equation so that other researchers can use our multivariate method.},

abstract = {A rabbit-census method, based on systematic counts conducted at night or at dawn and dusk, was developed and validated in terms of estimating the total number of rabbits present in a given area. Initially, models were developed under semi-natural conditions to describe the relationships between the numbers of rabbits counted and population size. Confidence limits were also calculated. The models were developed by comparing rabbit counts with the actual number of rabbits present, from a known population of animals. Only spotlight counts at night were considered reliable enough to estimate rabbit population size. During the autumn and winter months these represented similar to60% of the population present. The model was subsequently validated, in two different exercises, following a series of field trials conducted under a variety of conditions on commercial farms. Initially, population estimates derived from the model were compared with those calculated using an alternative census technique. Population estimates, using the two techniques, were very similar at nine of the ten study sites. A second validation exercise was also conducted whereby the number of rabbits removed at each of the sites was compared with the difference between the mean pre- and post-removal spotlight counts. The results further supported the proposition that spotlight counts represent similar to60% of the population present, with the difference between the two mean spotlight counts representing 61.2% (+/-11.0, s.d.) of the number of rabbits removed. The census method therefore shows considerable promise as a means to estimate rabbit numbers under a range of agricultural conditions and therefore has the potential to predict accurately the economic costs of rabbit damage and also to gauge the effectiveness of various methods of rabbit control.},

journal = {Wildlife Research},
volume = {46},

pages = {285-295},
abstract = {Context Relative abundance indices of wildlife can be scaled to give estimates of absolute abundance. Choice of scaling parameter depends on the data available and assumptions made about the relationship between the index and absolute abundance. Predation-mechanics theory suggests that a parameterisation involving the rate of successful search, s, will be useful where the area searched is unknown. An example arises during fox culling on shooting estates in Britain, where detection and cull data from gamekeepers using a spotlight and rifle are available, and can potentially be used to understand the population dynamics of the local population. Aims We aimed to develop an informative prior for s for use within a Bayesian framework to fit a fox population-dynamics model to detection data. Methods We developed a mechanistic model with a rate of successful search parameter for the gamekeeper-fox system. We established a mechanistic prior for s, using Monte Carlo simulation to combine relevant information on its component factors (detection probability, observer field of view and speed of travel). We obtained empirical estimates of s from a distance-sampling study of fox populations using similar survey methods, and used these as data in a Bayesian model to develop a mechanistic-empirical prior. We then applied this informative prior within a state-space model to estimate fox density from fox-detection rate on four estates. Key results The mechanistic-empirical prior for the rate of successful search was lognormally distributed with a median of 2.01 km(2) h(-1) (CV = 0.56). Underlying assumptions of the parameterisation were met. Local fox-density estimates obtained using informative priors closely reflected regional density. Conclusions A mechanistic understanding of the search process leading to fox detections by gamekeepers, and the use of Bayesian models, allowed the use of diverse sources of information to develop an informative prior for s that was useful in estimating fox density from detection data. Implications Careful use of prior knowledge within a Bayesian modelling framework can reduce uncertainty in population estimates derived from index data, and lead to improved management decisions. The mechanistic approach we have used will have parallel applications in many other contexts.},

abstract = {The rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a widespread, naturalized herbivore of many British dune systems. This paper presents preliminary results from Aberffraw, North Wales which illustrate how rabbit behavioural ecology should be integrated with the study of vegetation to elucidate the spatial and temporal impacts of this species on dune system dynamics. A pathway by which individual rabbit behaviours within dune systems may feed into community ecology and feed back to individual rabbit responses is presented. The potential for a behavioural approach to rabbit activities to explain more fully the mechanisms and patterns of rabbit influences across a range of scales is discussed.},

abstract = {Hunting is a common component in the management of ungulate species. Despite its widespread use, the influence of selective harvesting on phenotypic trait change is still ambiguous, and represents a critical gap in our understanding of the responses of wild populations under harvest. Using the long-term red deer (Cervus elaphus) dataset (1972-2012) from the Isle of Rum National Nature Reserve, Scotland, we assessed the relationship between antler length and key demographic processes (i.e., survival, recruitment, antler growth, parent-offspring trait correlation) for the male component of the population. We then constructed the first integral projection model for this species to examine the effects of simulated trophy hunting on 2 population-level parameters: the stable antler size distribution and the relative reproductive value of males. When male mortality rates due to hunting were <20%, the effect on antler size distribution and the reproductive value function were relatively small. However, as mortality due to hunting increased to 50% in large individuals, the direct effects of hunting on mean antler size and reproductive value became evident. Our model acts as a useful starting point to investigate the ecological and evolutionary consequences of hunting in red deer. (c) 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

volume = {7},
number = {2},
pages = {293-299},
abstract = {Temperate bats make extensive use of caves and mines as nursery roosts, swarming sites and hibernacula. For a variety of reasons, the entrances to many sites have been modified in the past to restrict human access. Early barrier design often gave little regard to bats, leading to massive population declines in many nursery and hibernation sites. Free access to bats has become an increasingly important design feature, as the damaging effects of early gates were recognised. However, given the large number of gates that have been constructed, relatively few Studies have looked at either the short or long-term effects of gates on bat behaviour and population sizes. Even fewer studies have examined specifically the effects of different gate designs. We have looked at the immediate effects of gates on the behaviour of swarming bats as they entered a natural cave. Three gates were tested, all with vertical grille spacings of 750 mm, but with horizontal spacings of 150, 130 or 100 mm. The gate with 150 mm spacings had no significant effect on the behaviour of the bats (predominantly Milotis nattereri). Gates with both 130 mm and 100 mm spacing caused a significant and substantial increase in the number of bats aborting their first and often subsequent attempts to enter the cave. The consequences to swarming behaviour and long-term use of the site by bats are unknown, but we suggest that following the precautionary principle, the Minimum Spacing between horizontal bars in gates should be 150 min.},

journal = {Mammal Review},
volume = {41},
number = {3},
pages = {175-196},
abstract = {At high densities, deer populations may have adverse effects upon and within their environment. In this review we explore published and unpublished information to derive density thresholds for deer species in relation to impacts upon agriculture, forestry, conservation habitats, road traffic, and human and livestock health in the UK. Impact levels are affected by many factors other than absolute density. We therefore seek to establish the range of densities within which negative impacts might start to occur and which should trigger objective monitoring of actual impacts. In commercial forestry, a threshold of 4 deer per 100ha has been suggested. Unfenced native woodlands seem to regenerate naturally if there are fewer than 4-5 large deer or fewer than 25 roe deer Capreolus capreolus per 100ha; open habitats may suffer only light or moderate impacts from red deer Cervus elaphus at landscape densities of 7-8 per 100ha. Woodland bird species may have declined where deer densities are high but absolute thresholds seem impossible to establish. One study suggests maximum diversity at about 8 white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus per 100ha. Deer-vehicle collisions are affected by various factors in addition to deer density, but British and American studies suggest that accident frequencies decline at densities below 7-8 per 100ha. Fallow deer Dama dama populations may maintain bovine TB (bTB) infection at much lower densities (25/100ha) than red or roe deer (91/100ha and 200/100ha, respectively) assuming 100% prevalence. Even at 30% prevalence a density of 75 fallow deer per 100ha could maintain bTB within the population. We conclude that deer density alone is unlikely to be a good predictor of impact, and suggest that long-term management should be based on assessment both of actual impacts and apparent density of deer.},

title = {Changes in bodyweight and productivity in resource-restricted populations of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in response to deliberate reductions in density},
journal = {European Journal of Wildlife Research},
volume = {65},
number = {1},
pages = {13},
abstract = {In resource-restricted populations of red deer, it is well-established that body size at maturity, female fecundity and calf survivorship are reduced, yet there are few formal studies documenting a reversal of these effects with reduction of density. In this paper, we consider changes in adult bodyweight and fecundity in populations of red deer in upland Scotland, before, during and after substantial reductions in population. Using generalised linear mixed models, we analysed changes in bodyweight and fecundity for 15,401 male and 21,053 female red deer culled from 9 different properties over periods from 9 to 35 years. After controlling for the effects of age, bodyweight in males showed a significant negative relationship with density and a significant positive relationship with the magnitude of reduction in density from that of the previous year as well as from population density recorded 2 and 3 years previously, implying that although main effects may relate to immediate reductions in density from that of the preceding year, increases in male bodyweight may be responding to cumulative reductions in densities as much as 3 years later. Analyses of female bodyweight yielded similar results with a direct and measurable effect of current density on age-related female bodyweight and significant effects of reductions in density in immediately preceding years. In this case, the model of best fit (lowest AIC score) is that incorporating a 3-year time lag, implying that bodyweight may be responding to the effects of cumulative culls over a preceding period of up to 3 years. Pregnancy rates among females were strongly influenced by bodyweight and prevailing (current) density (with females of higher bodyweight more likely to be pregnant), but there was no consistent effect of reduction of density on the probability of pregnancy of young females (aged < 4 years) or older animals (4 years or older). The probability of a lactating female becoming pregnant again in the same year was however significantly higher 1 year after a reduction in population density. While we focus in this paper on red deer, the results are applicable to other mammalian species where bodyweight is a major driver of fecundity. Our analyses suggest that some improvement in fertility and individual animal quality (bodyweight) may be expected where population densities of resource-limited populations are sufficiently reduced.},

abstract = {(1) The pattern of use of farmland and of different arable crops by roe deer Capreolus capreolus (L.), in relation to use of other 'natural' habitats available, was assessed for two populations of roe in southern Hampshire from April 1983 to March 1985. Use of all crops was highly seasonal with kale and fodder roots used primarily during autumn and early winter, and cereals exploited mainly from March to early June. (2) Even during periods of peak use, root crops and cereal fields (winter and spring wheat, spring barley) rarely supported more than 25% of the population at any time; wooded areas and rides and glades within woodland remained extremely important habitats at all times of year, and only in March-April and October-November did use of woodlands fall below 40% of habitat use overall. (3) Pastures were used extensively during spring and early summer (March-May), but analyses of habitat preference suggest that at no time did roe show positive selection for open agricultural land (pasture or cereals); woodland habitats by contrast showed positive preference throughout the year, and there was a slight selection for fodder root crops in winter. (4) Cereal crops subjected to damage by roe were surveyed, and resultant yield of damaged areas compared with that of control blocks. Damage to cereals was restricted to March, April and May, leaving considerable opportunity for recovery; in no instance was a significant loss of yield at harvest recorded due to roe damage. (5) Results are compared with published data on habitat use, and crop damage caused by deer in the more extensive agrocenoses of Eastern Europe.},

pages = {43-57},
abstract = {Statistics from the U.S. or from Continental Europe suggest that damage to persons and property arising from road or railway accidents involving deer amounts to a very significant annual total and is increasing everywhere. Despite this, the relative efficacy or cost-effectiveness of different control options is poorly understood. This review presents an analysis of deer movement patterns in relation to roads in order to try and develop some general conclusions about the probable or expected pattern and behaviour of road crossings. Based on such framework the various possible options available for reducing accident rates are more formally evaluated. The review focuses primarily on deer and roadside management within Europe. Approaches to the management of deer on roads consist either of methods to increase driver awareness of deer (deer warning signs) and/or methods to reduce deer crossing activity or change the pattern of crossings (fences, reflectors or chemical repellents). Effective reduction of deer road-crossings can only be assured in erection of a genuinely impermeable barrier fence. Cost considerations usually result in erection of barriers which are only partially effective. Such fencing must be viewed merely as a deterrent to crossing and not an absolute barrier; effectiveness can be enhanced by providing alternative means of passage, thus reducing the probability of deer intent on crossing, forcing the fence. Some means of exit (one-way gates, deer-leaps) should be provided for animals that do get on to the carriageway and are then unable to escape. Provision of fencing, with the additional structures of one-way gates and underpasses, is likely to be extremely costly; such high costs may only be justified in regard to major roads. For minor roads where traffic flow is lighter and intermittent, deer-mirrors or game-reflectors are a more economical and a more appropriate solution, since the intention is to delay crossing, rather than prevent it. The effectiveness of both fencing and mirrors may be reinforced in especially sensitive areas by erection of appropriate road signs to increase driver awareness. (C) 1997 Academic Press Limited.},

journal = {European Journal of Wildlife Research},
volume = {58},
number = {5},
pages = {781-796},
abstract = {For many of those wildlife species with larger home ranges, the expressed annual range size may extend over many landscape units and separate landholdings. In order to be wholly effective, management of such a population for control of numbers or in mitigation of negative impacts needs to be coordinated at the landscape scale rather than the level of individual properties. By corollary, differences in management of a population in different parts of the biological range (differences in intensity or objective of management) may have significant effects on numbers and distribution across the wider landscape. Thus, management in one part of their range towards one objective may compromise the ability of managers of the same population in another part of the range, to deliver their, perhaps different, objectives. This paper offers demonstration of such landscape level effects of differential intensity of culling, focusing on open hill populations of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Scotland. On each landholding within the wider catchment, mismatch between observed counts in a given year and population size and composition predicted from counts of previous years (on the basis of known 'domestic' rates of recruitment and known culls) permits identification of possible episodes of active immigration onto or emigration from that particular property/landholding. Coincidence in time of episodes of presumed immigration or emigration from adjoining land units may be used to infer movements of population between those landholdings and identify sources and sinks within the population's wider home range.},

abstract = {Density-related changes in performance have been documented for a number of different ungulate species, with recorded decline in body weight, fecundity and both juvenile and adult survival as population densities increase. While density-dependent responses of this kind have been explored in some detail in red, roe and fallow deer, little published information is available on demographic responses to density in European populations of sika deer (Cervus nippon). This paper offers an analysis of the dynamics of two populations of sika from the south of England from 1985-1993. Data on age-related body weights for males and females and pregnancy rates of females are taken from analysis of cull records of 321 males and 534 females culled during that 8-year period. We describe trends in body mass of adult and juvenile sika of both sexes, and consider changes in pregnancy rates of both mature and yearling females in relation to changes in relative abundance. Despite steadily increasing population density between 1985 and 1991/1992, no consistent decline was recorded in body weight or condition (as measured by % cover of kidney fat) for calves or yearlings of either sex, or for mature females. A decline in recorded body weight of adult males was not significantly correlated to ranked relative abundance. Fecundity was high (with > 90% of mature females sampled found pregnant). Most mature females found pregnant were also lactating. The proportion of animals that conceived as yearlings (72%) was lower than that recorded for more mature hinds; however there is some indication that the difference recorded may simply reflect the fact that yearlings may conceive later in the season than older animals. No significant differences were apparent in the proportion of either adult or yearling females found pregnant in different years.},

Differences in dietary composition and diet quality could be shown between males and females where buck and doe groups occupied discrete home ranges. Differences between the male and female diets were also maintained in areas where the two sexes, while still socially segregated, occupied overlapping ranges. Males had higher quality diets in winter, while females consumed higher quality diets in spring and summer.

abstract = {It has become increasingly clear that both density-dependent and density-independent factors may influence the dynamics of mammalian populations; it remains more difficult, however, to determine which factors may play the more significant role in influencing population number in any particular case. In this paper we review published and unpublished data in an analysis of the various factors affecting population size and trend in three European species of deer: Red Deer (Cervus elaphus), Fallow Deer (Dama dama) and Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus). We select these species deliberately because they span a range of body size and reproductive strategy - it seems that different demographic parameters might thus play different roles in the dynamics of the three-which may also be differentially sensitive to the effects of density-dependent and density-independent factors. For each species we examine the available evidence to determine the relative roles and effects of density-dependent feedback mechanisms and density-independent factors such as climate on recruitment and mortality. Despite differences in bionomic strategy between Red Deer (as essentially a K-strategist) and the more r-selected Roe, few differences emerge between the three species in the relative roles of density-dependent and density-independent factors - or of the stage at the life cycle at which each factor may act. Overall, however, it is clear that variation in density-independent factors, such as climate, appears primarily to affect levels of mortality within a population, while effects of density are particularly marked in relation to changes in recruitment.},

journal = {Mammal Review},
volume = {28},
number = {4},
pages = {141-163},
abstract = {Probably in response to recent changes in habitat structure, populations of a number of species of deer are increasing both in numbers and in geographical distribution in lowland Britain. In the wake of this expansion there is increasing awareness and concern over damage to agriculture/horticulture and forestry, as well as damage to sensitive vegetation in conservation areas. Despite a perception that damage levels an rising, data that actually quantify the scale of impact by deer on lowland agriculture and forestry interests or conservation habitats an scarce. This review attempts to draw together such objective data as are available to assess more formally the actual impact of deer damage in these different contexts and the economic significance of damage caused. The review concludes with a brief consideration of implications for management. The majority of agricultural damage reported in England and Wales was due to Fallow, Red and Roe Deer; Muntjac were only implicated in a little horticultural damage where they are numerous. Most reports were of damage to pasture or cereals, with oilseed rape, nursery and orchard crops also frequently damaged. Because of fundamental differences in ecology and distribution, different species of deer were implicated in different types of damage, depending on feeding habit and distribution in relation to geographical patterns of crop-type. In a woodland context, Fallow, Red and Roe Deer were implicated in the majority of reported damage in lowland UK, which is most frequent in the north of England and lowest in Wales. Despite the apparent severity of damage caused to agriculture or forestry, the actual economic significance of such damage would appear in many cases to be negligible or small. Field crops frequently recover completely from such damage, and although woodland crops may be checked and quality of the timber may be reduced as a consequence of earlier browsing damage, losses may be far less than they first appear. This whole question of the true economic cost of deer damage needs further research. Deer damage to conservation habitats in England and Wales appears largely restricted to woodland: impact on heathlands, grasslands and wetlands is generally welcomed as helping to arrest invasion of scrub. Within woodlands, while concern is expressed in a small number of cases over losses of sensitive ground flora or suppression of natural regeneration, the major problem is in damage to coppice regrowth on sites where coppice management has been recently reintroduced.},

Thirteen out of the 18 pairwise comparisons of bat passes, insect numbers, biomass and diversity were not significantly different. The oligotrophic Dee supported higher numbers of bats than the eutrophic Ythan in June, but this was attributed to an effect of adverse weather conditions affecting the Ythan. In July and August-September, neither bat abundances nor the abundance of Chironomidae and Trichoptera, the main food of the bats, differed significantly between the two rivers, although the Ythan showed higher total insect biomass than the Dee. The Ythan also showed a much higher abundance of small Diptera, mainly Psychodidae and Cecidomyiidae, associated with elevated nitrogen levels in the intensively farmed river valley. Thus a small eutrophic river can support as many bats and as high an insect density as a large oligotrophic one.},

Bat flight, foraging and social activity in natural birch woodland was compared with that in managed non-native coniferous woodland. Each area consists of riparian habitat, meadow-forest ecotone and dense forest. The activity of bats was highest in riparian habitat, then meadow, and lowest in dense woodland. P. pygmaeus was more abundant than P. pipistrellus in both areas, although in managed coniferous woodland only narrowly so (43.7% of all recorded bat flights, compared to 40.0% for common pipistrelle). In natural birch woodland, meadow habitat was most preferred by P. pipistrellus, and there was no significant difference between the use of riparian and woodland habitats, whereas in coniferous woodland, riparian habitat was most preferred. P. pygmaeus in both sites preferred riparian habitat, then meadow and forest least of all. The foraging activity of soprano pipistrelles was higher in birch than in coniferous woodland, whereas for the common pipistrelle, it was more evenly distributed. In both sites the lowest number of feeding buzzes was recorded in dense forest. In both study areas social calls were recorded, but many more for P. pygmaeus than for P. pipistrellus, especially in birch woodland. Soprano pipistrelle is a specialist species, focused mostly on riparian habitat, whereas common pipistrelle shows more generalistic behaviour. High number of social calls recorded near the waterbodies could suggest, that such habitat partitioning could be caused also by competitive behaviour.},

abstract = {We counted the births of greater horseshoe bats born at three small breeding colonies in southwest Wales and south-west England at the extreme edge of the species distribution over nine summers (1984-1993). Overall birth timing was almost identical at the three sites (mean of mean birth dates = 13-14 July), but varied widely from year to year. Mean birth timing was synchronized at the three sites in a given year. Early births followed warm springs; a significant negative regression of mean birth date on mean April plus May temperature was evident. A rise of 2-degrees-C accelerated mean birth date by about 18 days. Population levels fell at all three sites following the very late mean birth date of 28 July recorded in 1986, after an extremely cold spring and summer. Recovery of populations in all sites followed a series of warm springs and early mean birth dates, but was hampered by bith sex ratios favouring males for several years. These findings confirm climate, through its effect upon birth timing, and possibly also on sex ratios, as a major factor controlling bat populations, and hence the distribution of bat species.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the feeding ecology of mammalian herbivores is fundamental in predicting their responses to habitat change. Where native woodlands are newly established in open moorland, the extent to which trees form part of the diet of mountain hares (Lepus timidus) is unknown. This information is necessary for predicting the potential effects of mountain hare browsing on woodland establishment. The n-alkanes and a long-chain fatty alcohols found in the cuticular wax of diet plants and faeces (N=240) were used as markers to estimate the composition of the diet of mountain hares in an area of moorland with newly established Pinus sylvestris and Betula pubescens woodland. During winter, the diet of mountain hares was dominated by Calluna vulgaris, but there was a seasonal shift to a diet dominated by grasses, sedges, and rushes in summer. Pinus sylvestris and B. pubescens were minor dietary components in all seasons. A higher proportion of grasses, sedges, and rushes was found in the diet of lactating females. Results suggest that when an alternative browse species such as C. vulgaris is widely available, mountain hares may not have a large impact on the establishment of native woodland. The dietary results from this study are in broad agreement with those from previous studies using other techniques.},

abstract = {Mountain hares Lepus timidus L. typify species that occupy a broad geographic range and have flexible foraging and nutritional strategies. Such species may show a range of responses to habitat modification. This study aimed to provide a basis for prediction of the impact of mountain hares on woodland establishment, and of woodland establishment on mountain hare distribution. The selection of and the extent of incorporation of new woodland into the home range of mountain hares was investigated in an area where Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. woodland was establishing within their usual habitat in Britain, upland heather moorland. Seasonal home, day and night-range sizes of radio-tracked mountain hares were determined using the multinuclear probability polygon technique and analysed using residual maximum likelihood (REML). Habitat selection was analysed using compositional analysis. Three main habitat types were available to hares: heather moorland with trees, heather moorland and grassland-mire. Mean home-range size of mountain hares in summer was 10.3 ha and in winter 9.6 ha. There were no significant seasonal or sex differences in home-range size. Females selected grassland-mire habitat in summer and showed no strong selection for any habitat in winter. Males selected heather moorland in both summer and winter. Heather moorland with trees was not selected preferentially by mountain hares of either sex in summer or winter. The absence of selection for areas of newly establishing-Scots pine woodland suggests that any browsing damage to trees by hares is most likely to be a function of the local abundance of mountain hares, rather than a result of active preference of hares for the modified habitat.},

abstract = {Although spatial scale is important for understanding ecological processes and guiding conservation planning, studies combining a range of scales are rare. Habitat suitability modelling has been used traditionally to study broad-scale patterns of species distribution but can also be applied to address conservation needs at finer scales. We studied the ability of presence-only species distribution modelling to predict patterns of habitat selection at broad and fine spatial scales for one of the rarest mammals in the UK, the grey long-eared bat (Plecotus austriacus). Models were constructed with Maxent using broad-scale distribution data from across the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) and fine-scale radio-tracking data from bats at one colony. Fine-scale model predictions were evaluated with radio-tracking locations from bats from a distant colony, and compared with results of traditional radio-tracking data analysis methods (compositional analysis of habitat selection). Broad-scale models indicated that winter temperature, summer precipitation and land cover were the most important variables limiting the distribution of the grey long-eared bat in the UK. Fine-scale models predicted that proximity to unimproved grasslands and distance to suburban areas determine foraging habitat suitability around maternity colonies, while compositional analysis also identified unimproved grasslands as the most preferred foraging habitat type. This strong association with unimproved lowland grasslands highlights the potential importance of changes in agricultural practices in the past century for wildlife conservation. Hence, multi-scale models offer an important tool for identifying conservation requirements at the fine landscape level that can guide national-level conservation management practices.

abstract = {Aim A common pattern in biogeography is the scale-dependent effect of environmental variables on the spatial distribution of species. We tested the role of climatic and land cover variables in structuring the distribution of genetic variation in the grey long-eared bat, Plecotus austriacus, across spatial scales. Although landscape genetics has been widely used to describe spatial patterns of gene flow in a variety of taxa, volant animals have generally been neglected because of their perceived high dispersal potential. Location England and Europe. Methods We used a multiscale integrated approach, combining population genetics with species distribution modelling and geographical information under a causal modelling framework, to identify landscape barriers to gene flow and their effect on population structure and conservation status. Genotyping involved 23 polymorphic microsatellites and 259 samples from across the species' range. Results We identified distinct population structure shaped by geographical barriers and evidence of population fragmentation at the northern edge of the range. Habitat suitability (as captured by species distribution models, SDMs) was the most important landscape variable affecting genetic connectivity at the broad spatial scale, while at the fine scale, lowland unimproved grasslands, the main foraging habitat of P. austriacus, played a pivotal role in promoting genetic connectivity. Main conclusions The importance of lowland unimproved grasslands in determining the biogeography and genetic connectivity in P. austriacus highlights the importance of their conservation as part of a wider landscape management for fragmented edge populations. This study illustrates the value of using SDMs in landscape genetics and highlights the need for multiscale approaches when studying genetic connectivity in volant animals or taxa with similar dispersal abilities.},

abstract = {Data from a Badger sett survey undertaken in the mid-1980s were used to calculate the effects of past persecution and land-use changes on Badger numbers. The current British Badger population was estimated to be 41,894 +/- 4404 social groups; if the effects of past persecution were eliminated, the population could be 43,437 +/- 4731 social groups, an increase of 3.7%. Most of this increase relates to persecution in Norfolk and Suffolk last century. In Britain the Badger population is largely confined to those areas which are intensively managed, and the numbers and distribution of Badgers reflect patterns of agricultural activity. However, over-intensive use of the landscape is detrimental to Badger numbers. To quantify the impact of land-use changes on the British Badger population, a number of habitat features favourable to Badgers were identified; 1-km squares that contained five or more such features had significantly higher mean Badger densities. If all the 1-km squares were managed to include five or more of the habitat features favoured by Badgers, and the effects of persecution were eliminated, the Badger population could be 58,284 +/- 5640 social groups, an increase of 39%. The absence of semi-natural broadleaved woodlands in a 1-km square had the greatest effect in reducing Badger numbers, and tree-planting schemes may be beneficial in providing potential new sett sites. However, Badgers are poor colonists, and the construction of artificial setts and the translocation of displaced social groups of Badgers will greatly facilitate the colonization process. The value of such an approach for predicting the effects of future land-use policy on Badgers and other species, and for managing the British wildlife resources, is discussed.},

In Scotland, however, little information is available on harrier diet in the spring and our understanding of causes of variation in harrier breeding density is complicated by human interference, In this paper we explore the relationship between Field Vole Microtus agrestis abundance and harrier spring diet, density and productivity in southern Scotland. Over three years, voles occurred on average in 67% of pellets, and 79% in years of high and intermediate vole abundance. From 1992, the number of breeding harriers increased following protection from illegal persecution. After accounting for this trend, harrier numbers correlated strongly with vole abundance. Harrier clutch size was also correlated with vole abundance. Although fledging success tended to be greater in years of vole increase than in years of vole decline, fledging success was not significantly correlated with the relative abundance of voles, or with the abundance of Meadow Pipits or Red Grouse chicks.},

journal = {Journal of Applied Ecology},

abstract = {Agri-environment schemes (AESs) are designed to create landscape-scale improvements in biodiversity. While the specific aims of AESs do not always include the enhancement of species of conservation concern, associated conservation strategies, such as the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, often rest on the assumption that AESs enhance environmental conditions and thereby improve the conservation status of target species. However, there is little evidence for the general efficacy of AESs in this respect. To evaluate the effects of the Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) scheme, a widespread AES in Northern Ireland, a spotlight survey of the relative abundance of three mammal species, Irish hare Lepus timidus hibernicus, European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and red fox Vulpes vulpes, was conducted. Of these, the Irish hare is a priority species for conservation action and the focus of a species action plan, while rabbit and fox are commonly considered agricultural pests. The effects of ESA designation and habitat on each species were assessed at 150 ESA and 50 non-ESA sites, matched for landscape characteristics. The ESA scheme had no demonstrable effect on the abundance of Irish hares, and this agri-environment scheme did not target the landscape and habitat variables associated with hares. In contrast, the abundance of rabbits and foxes was significantly greater within ESAs than the wider countryside. Agricultural factors such as reduced livestock stocking density, reduced overgrazing and field boundary enhancements may create more favourable conditions for both species. Aside from the implications for farm economics, the proliferation of rabbit populations within conservation areas may raise issues concerning the grazing of important plant communities, while increases in fox populations may adversely affect ground-nesting birds and other animal species of conservation concern. Synthesis and applications. The abundance of rabbits and foxes corroborates recent work that suggests AESs may benefit common species but can not be relied upon to encourage rarer species. The Irish hare species action plan relies on agri-environment schemes to enhance the species' status and realize the target of increasing the hare population by 2010 by promoting suitable habitat. However, the ESA scheme is unlikely to help in achieving these objectives. Targeted and evidence-based agri-environment prescriptions are clearly required in order to ensure the realization of species-specific conservation targets.},

Strong support was found for thresholds in margin width below which vole abundance was extremely low. Narrow margins were male biased with individuals moving greater distances and a large proportion of males behaved as transient individuals. However, no effect was observed on the age structure or survival of the population. Individuals were able to compensate for the lack of habitat through alterations in their behaviour sufficiently to maintain their survival. Within intensive agro-ecosystems, narrow strips between crops are important links for voles between wider margins and, if available, other more suitable habitats. Maintenance of narrow margins, along with larger areas of suitable habitat, is therefore effective in farmed landscapes for sustaining populations of specialist species where they show sufficient flexibility.

(2) Colonization of the region by invading grey squirrels was patchy, and pioneer populations were often detached from the main distribution of the species. Similarly, the red squirrel in decline was reduced to scattered `island' populations. (3) Interaction between the two species could at the most provide a partial explanation of red squirrel decline: in many cases red squirrels became locally extinct before establishment of grey squirrels in the same area. In other cases, coexistence occurred for up to 16 years, or continued in 1982. Grey squirrel presence per se did not enhance the probability of red squirrel extinction. However, the more plausible possibilities of density-dependent interaction could not be tested in this extensive approach. (4) The loss of local red squirrel populations showed no temporal or spatial grouping. (5) A viral disease caused high death-rates locally in red squirrel populations, sometimes resulting in local extinction, but was not recorded in grey squirrels. Outbreaks frequently arose outside the current geographical range of the grey squirrel, weakening the hypothesis of the latter species as an immune vector. Outbreaks showed no temporal grouping.

Detections and captures showed seasonal peaks in every year corresponding to known dispersal periods, but also declined steadily from year to year, with increasing periods in which we did not detect mink. These results suggested that each sub-catchment was cleared of mink within a few months, with subsequent captures attributable to immigration. On average, we detected each mink 5.1 times before capture (daily probability of detection=0.059 per mink and raft), and trapped them 3.4 days after deploying traps in response.

abstract = {1. Foxes Vulpes vulpes probably did not occur naturally on the Isle of Man, but were present in small numbers in the mid 19th century. They were introduced again in the 1980s, and in 1990 the population was estimated at 120-300 individuals (20-50 per 100 km(2)) on the basis of field signs. We used a nocturnal spotlight transect survey technique to assess the status of foxes on the Isle of Man in September 1999. This method had previously been used effectively to estimate fox densities in populations as sparse as 16 per 100 km(2) . We surveyed a total of 852 km over a period of eight consecutive nights, during weather conditions which allowed excellent visibility. No foxes were seen. 2. By comparison with equivalent survey efforts in reference areas of mainland Britain, we conclude that post-breeding fox density on the Isle of Man was certainly below 2.5 per 100 km(2) , implying a maximum of 15 foxes on the entire island. We estimate a probability of only 15-25% that a fox population of 1 per 100 km(2) was present but not detected; this would be equivalent to only five or six individuals on the whole island. Foxes may even be entirely absent, although unsubstantiated sightings continue to be reported. 3. This finding is significant in understanding the ecology of the Isle of Man, and in planning the conservation of a number of ground-nesting bird species there, as well as for farming interests, and for contingency planning against an accidental introduction of rabies.},

title = {The consequences of predator control for brown hares (Lepus europaeus) on UK farmland},
journal = {European Journal of Wildlife Research},
volume = {56},

pages = {541-549},
abstract = {The brown hare Lepus europaeus is a valued game species but also a species of conservation concern owing to its severe decline in abundance on farmland throughout Europe during the twentieth century. Changes in the farmland habitat and predation have both been cited as causative factors. Their relative roles have been unclear, but most conservation action has focused on improving habitat. We analyse data from a sequence of three unique studies (one experiment and two demonstrations) covering the period 1985-2006 in which control of several common predator species was undertaken to increase densities of wild game on farmland in England. Across the three studies, regression modelling of the proportional change in hare numbers between successive years showed that-after site, year differences and harvesting were accounted for-predator control was a significant determinant of hare population change. Where habitat improvement also took place, hares reached autumn densities that were exceptional for the UK and which could sustain substantial harvests. When predation control was stopped, hare densities fell, even where habitat improvements remained in place. This analysis demonstrates that even where farmland habitat is greatly improved, uncontrolled predation prevents hares making full use of its carrying capacity. This helps explain the mixed-and at best modest-success of agri-environment schemes in the UK and elsewhere in Europe to increase hare densities. Game-shooting estates, on which effective predator control takes place, probably have a special significance within the landscape as source areas for brown hares.},

Four small game species within this size range - brown hare Lepus europaeus, pheasant Phasianus colchicus, grey partridge Perdix perdix, and redleg partridge Alectoris rufa - were also censussed twice a year throughout the study. Fox diet was determined by analysis of faecal material, with diet of cubs at breeding dens analysed separately. Two-thirds of fox diet consisted of vertebrate prey in the range 0.3-3.0 kg. Prey types of overwhelming importance for foxes in other environments - such as small rodents, fruit and invertebrates - each contributed 10% or less to fox diet. Fox territory size was determined by radio-tracking eight adult foxes during a three-year period in spring, summer and autumn.

journal = {Journal of Zoology},
volume = {233},
pages = {605-616},
abstract = {In captivity, Orkney voles Microtus arvalis orcadensis show an activity pattern that consists of regularly alternating periods of rest and activity with a periodicity of about 2.8 hours. Captive voles kept under ambient conditions are equally active day and night at all times of the year. Free-living voles also show a regular short-term rhythm of activity but in addition the partition of activity between day and night varies seasonally. At two sites on Orkney Mainland cyclic variation in diurnality with a period of 12 months were recorded. Although surface activity occurred during both the day and night throughout the year, day activity predominated, particularly during the winter months. The cycle appeared to be synchronous at the two study sites. Seasonal variation in diurnality appeared to be associated with population density and due largely to the proportion of juveniles in the population. Given the IZ-month cycle of diurnality found in the Orkney vole, phase relationships with photoperiod are likely to be consistent between years. This may explain why populations of this subspecies do not appear to undergo multi-annual population cycles. Despite intense levels of predation by raptors, including the short-eared owl which switches between nocturnal and diurnal hunting, Orkney voles exhibit a relatively simple and highly predictable cycle of diurnality. This cycle is unlikely therefore to have evolved asa means of preventing predator specialization with respect to time of day, season or year.},

abstract = {Members of the genus Sciurus store seed when plentiful by scatterhoarding. Such caches are impossible to defend and vulnerable to both interspecific and intraspecific competitors. In view of the delicate position held by Red Squirrels Sciurus vulgaris L. in Britain it is of value to extend to this species studies of the methods whereby such competition is reduced. Caching behaviour in a population of Red Squirrels living in a protected reserve and receiving supplementary food was studied for 18 months. Two main aspects were investigated; their ability to find caches they had not made, and their efforts to reduce competition for caches they did make. Stapanian & Smith (1978) predicted that caches are made at an optimal density and that the entire 360-degrees arc around a resource is used. This study upheld this second prediction but not the first for the population of Red Squirrels in question. In addition, it is suggested that caching cannot be considered to be permanent under conditions of surplus food.},

pages = {539-549},
abstract = {Water voles have suffered large population declines in the United Kingdom due to habitat degradation and predation by invasive American mink. Habitat restoration of floodplain wetlands could help to reverse this decline, but the detailed habitat preferences of water voles in these environments have not been well studied, and the impacts of restoration practices on water vole populations are not known. This study investigated the habitat preferences of water voles in a reconnected lowland river floodplain. The results show that water voles preferred wider water bodies, and taller and more diverse vegetation. The impact of flooding on water voles was also investigated by comparing their occurrence between two survey periods which were separated by large flood events, and by comparing distribution patterns before and after restoration. Contrary to previous reports, there was no observed negative impact of flood events on water vole distribution, which has slightly expanded since the floodplain was reconnected to the river in 2009. Overall this study demonstrates that restored wetlands can provide suitable habitat for water voles, and provides guidance on some of the factors which should be considered when designing floodplains for water vole conservation.},

journal = {Biological Conservation},
volume = {231},
pages = {98-102},
abstract = {Robust ecological assessments are fundamental for effective wildlife conservation. Owing to the high legal protection of bats, surveys are frequently required as part of ecological assessments. Yet there is uncertainty about the amount of survey effort that should be deployed to facilitate bat protection. Bat activity can be extremely variable, and capturing periods of high activity can be as important as estimating parameters such as the median activity level. However the frequency and intensity of surveys required to capture the required information is unknown. Here we assessed the probability that acoustic surveys of differing durations would detect periods of high activity within a focal site and the importance of a site relative to others in a regional or national context. We randomly subsampled from 660 nights of activity data collected from 33 wind farm sites across Britain. The minimum surveying effort required to classify bat activity accurately varied between species and was dependent on weather conditions. We found that the survey periods required to give reasonable certainty in assessing risk exceeded those currently recommended in Europe. The approach of using bat activity accumulation curves, as described here, is transferrable to other situations where determining surveying effort and risk is necessary to ensure that ecological assessments provide a robust evidence base, whilst minimising the time and expense of surveys.},

pages = {215-226},
abstract = {Many species of temperate bats visit underground sites in autumn, prior to hibernation, and chase each other in and around the entrances in an event known as autumn swarming. It has been suggested that swarming is a mating event that facilitates gene flow between bats from otherwise isolated summer colonies. we describe swarming behaviour at a cluster of four caves in the North of England and provide direct evidence for seasonal migration of Natterer's bats (Myotis nattereri) between these caves and many summer nursery roosts in a catchment area of at least 60 km radius. Mark-recapture analysis suggests that an estimated 2000-6000 Natterer's bats use the three best-studied caves, together with smaller numbers of four other species: M. daubentonii, M. brandtii, M. mystacinus and Plecotus auritus. Recaptures also show that there is a small interchange of bats between these three caves, which are 0.6-1.5 km apart. Capture rates, automatic logging and video recordings at one cave suggest that an average 310-400 bats visit the cave each night. Mating at swarming sites would be particularly important for gene flow if a species showed no other dispersal pattern. We provide evidence for natal philopatry, with little or no dispersal, in both sexes of Natterer's bats. The protection of swarming sites is discussed in light of our findings. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Individual specialisation has been identified in an increasing number of animal species and populations. However, in some groups, such as terrestrial mammals, it is difficult to disentangle individual niche variation from spatial variation in resource availability. In the present study, we investigate individual variation in the foraging niche of the European badger (Meles meles), a social carnivore that lives in a shared group territory, but forages predominantly alone. Using stable isotope analysis, we distinguish the extent to which foraging variation in badgers is determined by social and spatial constraints and by individual differences within groups. We found a tendency for individual badgers within groups to differ markedly and consistently in their isotope values, suggesting that individuals living with access to the same resources occupied distinctive foraging niches. Although sex had a significant effect on isotope values, substantial variation within groups occurred independently of age and sex. Individual differences were consistent over a period of several months and in some instances were highly consistent across the two years of the study, suggesting long-term individual foraging specialisations. Individual specialisation in foraging may, therefore, persist in populations of territorial species not solely as a result of spatial variation in resources, but also arising from individuals selecting differently from the same available resources. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, we suggest that specialisation may occur due to learning trade-offs which may limit individual niche widths. However, ecological factors at the group level, such as competition, may also influence the degree of specialisation.},

abstract = {Although intra-population variation in niches is a widespread phenomenon with important implications for ecology, evolution and management of a range of animal species, the causes and consequences of this variation remain poorly understood. We used stable isotope analysis to characterise foraging niches and to investigate the causes and consequences of individual niche variation in the European badger, a mustelid mammal that lives in territorial social groups, but forages alone. We found that the degree of individual niche variation within social groups was negatively related to the availability of farmland habitats, which represent an important foraging habitat for badgers; and was positively related to territory size, supporting the idea that resource limitation and ecological opportunity lead to increased individual specialisation. We also found that the degree of individual specialisation related to an individual's body condition and that this effect varied with ecological context; such that specialisation had a stronger positive relationship with body condition in social groups with reduced availability of key farmland habitats. Body condition was also related to the utilisation of specific resources (woodland invertebrates), but again this relationship varied with the availability of farmland foraging habitats. This study supports the idea that resource availability plays an important role in determining patterns of individual niche variation, and identifies the potential adaptive consequences of specialised foraging strategies.},

abstract = {The resource dispersion hypothesis (RDH) predicts that resource heterogeneity can act as a passive cause of group-living in social carnivores and potentially many other species. One central prediction of the RDH is that territory size and group size are not related, as they are determined by resource dispersion and quality, respectively. In this study we investigated the relationship between territory size, group size and group composition in the European badger, a non-cooperative social mustelid whose behavioural ecology was central to the development of the RDH. Using data from a long-term study in the UK, we found that territory size and group size were positively related, contradicting a core prediction of the RDH. Furthermore, territory size was more strongly correlated with the number of adult males in the group than to the number of females or total group size. This result suggests that male badgers may have a more important role in territoriality and receive greater benefits from territory enlargement. These findings are consistent with the predictions of the anti-kleptogamy hypothesis, and suggest that badger territorial and social behaviour is not purely driven by resource dispersion, but may also be associated with breeding behaviour, as in other mustelids.},

abstract = {The diurnal and nocturnal movement patterns of juvenile foxes Vulpes vulpes (Linneaus, 1758) were investigated in Bristol, UK. juvenile and adult foxes were radio-tracked between May and December in three consecutive years. In the months preceding the main dispersal period (May-September), cubs showed a gradual increase in the area over which they ranged, and this was reflected both in the use of diurnal lying-up sites and nocturnal patterns of movement. However, their behaviour was highly focused at secure den sites and rendezvous sites. There was no significant difference in the movement patterns of male and female cubs. By the end of August, the nocturnal movement patterns of cubs were comparable with resident adult animals with the exception of their average speed of travel. During the onset of the main dispersal period (October-December) subadults showed the same movement patterns as adults. These results are discussed within the context of fox management by the distribution of baits, it is proposed that the low bait uptake rate of juveniles is associated with their limited ranging behaviour as cubs, and with differences in patterns of range utilisation as subadults.},

abstract = {The diet of Eptesicus serotinus was investigated by faecal analysis and the validity of this technique as a means of obtaining reliable quantitative results was assessed. Knowledge of what the bats cat will allow predictions of which habitats contribute most prey. Three male serotines were kept in captivity during the months of July and August 1991 and fed known quantities of identified insects. With captive E. serotinus the remains of prey appeared within 33 min of first bite and continued to appear for up to 32 h after consumption. Scales from two Noctua pronuba moths consumed were contained in 59 subsequent droppings. Similarly, fragments of three beetles, Geotrupes stercorarius, were contained in 28 subsequent faeces. Analysis of the faeces of free-living bats revealed insects from seven orders. Coleoptera were found to be present in 96.1% of the droppings examined; the next most frequently found order was Lepidoptera, occurring in 14.7%. The beetles were mostly associated with hay meadows (Amphimallon spp. and Melolontha spp.), or grazed pasture (Aphodius spp. and Geotrupes spp.). Quantitative determination of prey eaten is not possible owing to the large number of the droppings shown to contain the remains of marker insects and the long period over which they are produced.},

abstract = {Serotine nursery roosts with less than 20 bats were found to have home ranges of at least 24 to 77 km(2) and core areas of activity from 13 to 33 km(2). The size of the range may have increased further if more individuals had been tracked, as three of the four colonies studied had not reached their asymptotes. The total home-range area covered by four serotine colonies was 127.36 km(2). Excluding non-breeding bats, a density of one bat per 120 ha was estimated. However, actual density was likely to be higher if there were additional non-breeding females and immatures that were not in nursery roosts. Colonial home ranges and core areas overlapped, with individuals from different colonies feeding at the same sites. Individual home ranges (n = 32) varied from 0.16 to 47.58 km(2), but these were not used exclusively by one individual. Around the colonial core area and breeding roosts, home ranges were used by all individuals from a single colony. It is only further from the core area that ranges appeared to be used by individuals. The distance from roost to feeding areas varied by up to 7.4 lan, but the bat usually commuted along lines of trees and hedges and over pastures. This resulted in greater distances being travelled than if they had flown by a direct route. On average, individuals commuted distances of 8 km each night between feeding areas, with a maximum distance of over 41 lan. They visited between 0 and 10 feeding sites each night (mean = 2.89).},

abstract = {1. The distribution and diet of two groups of captive-bred, re-introduced otters Lutra lutra (L.) was assessed through the collection and analysis of spraints (faeces), collected between July 1992 and March 1994 from the Rivers Stort, Lee and Rib in Hertfordshire (UK). 2. Almost immediately after release in 1991, both groups of otters moved upstream of their release sites. In February 1992, one male was found dead on a road near the River Stort, and both groups appeared to have moved downstream, their total range eventually extending to about 40 km, from 8 km downstream of the confluence of the Rivers Stort and Lee to about 16 km up the Stort and 16 km up the Lee. 3. Fish, principally cyprinids, formed the major dietary element, with spatial differences in prey availability influencing the range of secondary items taken. Eels were the only prey category to show significant seasonal variation in spraints, occurring more often than expected in spring and summer spraints. Mammals/amphibia and birds were taken as prey only occasionally. Where environmental quality and/or prey species diversity were low, small-bodied fish species, such as three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, bullhead Cottus gobio and stone leach Barbatula barbatula, occurred more frequently in the diet. 4. Only two of the seven IUCN criteria for re-introductions appear to have been met before the otters' release, and subsequent assessments suggest that most other criteria were not. As there has been only one possible, but unconfirmed, sighting of a female with cubs, it remains unclear whether the released otters have reproduced and thus the success of the re-introduction is doubtful.},

Plagiorchis muris was found to be the dominant intestinal trematode and occurred in every year of sampling, with an overall prevalence of 16.9%. This appears to be the first record of P. muris in A. sylvaticus within the UK. The mean worm burden was 2.03 and the distribution of the parasite within mice was typically overdispersed. No difference in prevalence relative to host sex was evident although there was a higher prevalence of 21.9% in larger older mice compared with 9.1% in juveniles, which probably relates to a greater foraging activity in older mice. Annual prevalence values of R muris infections varied significantly over the study period with higher prevalences being associated with years with a high spring/summer rainfall. The second intermediate hosts for P. muris include a variety of aquatic insect larvae and it is likely that the higher rainfall may result in the occurrence of temporary water bodies suitable for the development of insect larvae.},

Of those badgers whose capture history could be categorized, nearly half had moved. Of these, 73.1% were classified as 'occasional movers: 22.1% as 'permanent movers' and 4.8% as 'frequent movers: Most adult badgers that moved made occasional moves (78.8%, n=67). Cubs made all types of move including permanent moves (29%, n=10). Seventy per cent of females were non-movers compared with 37% of males. Badgers were significantly more likely to move to smaller groups, whereas male badgers were significantly more likely to move to groups with a greater proportion of females. The spatial pattern of movement differed from the distribution of groups with bovine tuberculosis in the study area. However, temporal changes in movement were significantly related to the incidence of Mycobacterium bovis infection in the following year, indicating that as the movement of badgers between groups varies so does the incidence of bovine tuberculosis in the population. This finding is of central importance in the formulation of badger control policy.},

volume = {260},
pages = {209-215},
abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the number of occupied setts in a badger social group territory and badger group size, breeding success, and status of infection with Mycobacterium bovis (TB). The data used were from a long-term epidemiological and ecological study of a high-density population of badgers Meles meles in south-west England. The number of occupied setts in a social group was significantly and positively related to the number of badgers caught in the social group, so that as a social group increases in size, badgers occupy more of the available setts. This relationship remained significant when numbers of adults, adult males and adult females were examined. The number of breeding females, number of cubs and sex ratio was not related to the number of occupied setts in a social group. It is possible that the advantages to breeding females of a larger number of setts available to breed in might be outweighed by the increased aggression found in larger groups. The TB score for prevalence and for incidence of social groups was significantly and positively related to the number of occupied setts in a social group, such that the more occupied setts there were in a territory, the higher the TB index of the group. Possibly the setts themselves contribute to the persistence of TB within social groups, or badgers infected with TB might show a difference in behaviour from uninfected badgers resulting in their increased use of outlying setts.},

abstract = {1. Movements of hedgehogs, Erinaceus europaeus L., were analysed in relation to roads by recording their nocturnal foraging trajectories in urban areas adjacent to major road systems. Four male and four female hedgehogs at each of two sites were each tracked over five replicate trajectories of more than 3 h, using radio-telemetry and direct observation. 2. Frequency of road crossings and use of habitat were compared to simulated random trajectories. For each observed trajectory, 100 trajectories were simulated with the same distribution of speeds as observed, but with random direction. 3. Observed trajectories had lower rates of crossing large but not small roads than simulated, indicating that hedgehogs treat large roads as barriers during nightly foraging activities. Most hedgehogs were never observed to cross roads, whereas almost all simulated trajectories did cross both large and small roads. 4. Crossing behaviour differed by site, but not by sex. 5. Roads and road verges had the lowest rank in a habitat preference analysis at both sites, while playing fields, gardens and urban areas were preferred habitats. These results are discussed in relation to the regional scale preference for urban areas, and the attraction to road verges while dispersing, shown by hedgehogs.},

volume = {234},
pages = {437-452},
abstract = {Although most authors characterize the badger Meles meles as an omnivore, the species is sometimes described as a food specialist and in particular as a specialist predator on earthworms Lumbricus terrestris. The validity of the 'food specialist' hypothesis is examined, using data from 11 quantitative studies of badger diet to test two predictions: 1) any one population of badgers relies to a disproportionate extent on a single type of food; and 2) consumption of the predominate food is independent of its availability. As regards the first prediction, when data on year-round consumption were corrected for seasonal variation in total intake, no study showed earthworms to comprise more than 50% of the diet and in three studies they accounted for no more than 5% of intake. In two studies, fruit comprised more than 50% of the diet and fruit and insects together accounted for 95-97% of total consumption. Compared across different studies, consumption of any one food, including earthworms, varied more or less continuously across a wide spectrum of values, providing no support for the idea that a given food can be characterized as being of either major or minor importance. With respect to the second prediction, there was no evidence that consumption of either earthworms or any other food was consistently invariant across seasons; and in any case, the idea that badger diet contains a constant proportion of any one food does not make functional sense. Taken together with information about the morphology of the digestive system and a priori arguments about the conditions in which food specialization is likely to be adaptive, studies of diet confirm that the badger is best viewed as a generalist or opportunist feeder.},

journal = {Behaviour},
volume = {127},
pages = {289-307},
abstract = {Badgers (Meles meles) defecate, urinate and scent mark at latrines which seem to have a territorial function. The main aim of the present study was to compare defecation patterns at boundary and hinterland latrines, in order to test the hypothesis that these two types of latrine have a similar function. We investigated latrine use by means of a year-round survey of all the latrines in 7 badger territories, by bait-marking of 15 territories, and by monitoring latrine use in 6 radio-collared badgers belonging to three social groups. The spatial distribution of latrines within a territory was bimodal, with the greatest densities of latrines close to the outside, and close to the centre, of the territory respectively. Boundary latrines were larger and more consistently used than hinterland latrines, but these differences could be accounted for by the fact that boundary latrines are visited by the members of more than one social group. Defecation at latrines was subject to seasonal variation, with a major peak in latrine use in spring and a minor peak in autumn. The spring peak was largely attributable to an increase in the use of hinterland latrines, the autumn peak to an increase in the use of boundary latrines. Males visited boundary latrines considerably more often than did females, but both sexes visited hinterland latrines equally often. Overmarking occurred equally often at both types of latrine and involved animals from the same as well as from different groups, but there was a significant tendency for more between-group than within-group overmarking. Overmarking occurred mainly on fresh, as opposed to old, faeces deposits. The sex and seasonal differences in use of boundary latrines suggest that these function at least partly as a form of mate-guarding, to deter neighbouring males from entering a territory for mating purposes. It is less clear why females mark at hinterland latrines. One possibility, consistent with the observed spatial distribution of hinterland latrines, is that they function to defend the main burrow system, which is used for breeding; another is that they carry information about social status. Overmarking probably serves to obliterate the marks of competitors, which are members of neighbouring social groups in the case of boundary latrines, but may be members of the same social group in the case of hinterland latrines. We conclude that previous ideas about the function of territoriality in badgers, and about the information conveyed by latrines, are oversimplified.},

abstract = {1. During 1986 and 1987 we surveyed 15 wheat and 15 barley fields for damage caused by badgers, in an area in the south of England where badger density was moderately high (7.5 adults Km(-2)). In the case of wheat, actual grain losses were estimated after the harvest by comparing the number of unharvested ears remaining in badger-damaged and undamaged areas. Direct observations of 11 radio-collared badgers from four neighbouring social groups were carried out in order to determine how and when crops were damaged. 2. Badgers damaged cereal crops by making paths through them and by flattening patches of crops while feeding on them. Paths and patches were more numerous in wheat than in barley, patches were larger in wheat; badgers commenced feeding on wheat earlier in the season; and feeding bouts were longer in wheat. Of Il radio-collared badgers which had access to both crops, all fed on wheat but only five fed on barley. We conclude that badgers prefer wheat to barley when both are available. 3. Overall, 0.25% of the crop by area was damaged in the case of wheat and 0.05% in the case of barley. Average grain losses for wheat amounted to 7.21 kg ha(-1), or <0.1% of the total crop. Damage was not severe enough to make deterrence, for example by electric fencing, cost-effective. 4. Consumption of standing wheat began in early May, after which the time that badgers spent in wheat fields increased until September. Members of any one social group of badgers restricted their foraging to a few specific arena within the cereal fields available to them, and these areas were usually close to field edges, After the harvest, individuals ranged more widely and foraged independently of one another, gleaning spilled grain from stubble fields. In winter and early spring, wheat was taken from barns and grain stores.},

The process of dispersal took from 2 to 9 months. Dispersing animals first made nocturnal forays into the new territory but returned to their own territory to sleep. They then began to sleep progressively more often in setts in the new territory, and less often in their original territory. During this period, dispersers foraged in both the old and the new territory, before eventually settling into a home range centred exclusively on the new territory. 4. We conclude that dispersal can be a lengthy and complex process, even when the distance involved is small.},

abstract = {The European badger Meles meles constructs burrows of two basic types: 'main setts' and 'outliers'. We examined daytime burrow use year-round in 19 radio-collared badgers belonging to six different social groups, in order to test the hypotheses relating use of multiple sleeping sites to ectoparasite avoidance and social status. Ten animals rarely or never slept away from the main sett, while the remaining nine animals spent 20-73% of their days in outliers, mainly in summer. Outlier use was not related to sex or body condition, but animals that used outliers tended to be younger and had larger numbers of fleas than those that remained in the main sett year-round. Within the main sett, all the members of a social group had overlapping ranges: i.e. the sett was not divided into separate 'territories'. Group ranges were smallest in winter and largest in summer/autumn. Nest chambers were usually shared between at least two members of a social group on any one day, but males slept alone more often than did females. Individuals tended to cluster together in the same nest chamber more in winter than at other times of pear, presumably to gain thermoregulatory advantage from huddling. We conclude that the pattern of burrow use in badgers is complex. Use of space within the main sett and tendency to disperse to outliers in the summer are in pan affected by ectoparasite infestation, while use of space within the main sett is also influenced by variables such as sex and age that may reflect social status.},

abstract = {The distribution of genetic variability across a species' range can provide valuable insights into colonization history. To assess the relative importance of European and Asian refugia in shaping current levels of genetic variation in the greater horseshoe bats, we applied a microsatellite-based approach to data collected from 56 localities ranging from the UK to Japan. A decline in allelic richness from west Asia to the UK and analyses of F-ST both imply a northwestward colonization across Europe. However, sharp discontinuities in gene frequencies within Europe and between the Balkans and west Asia (Syria/Russia) are consistent with suture zones following expansion from multiple refugia, and a lack of recent gene flow from Asia Minor. Together, these results suggest European populations originated from west Asia in the ancient past, and experienced a more recent range expansion since the Last Glacial Maximum. Current populations in central Europe appear to originate from the Balkans and those from west Europe from either Iberia and/or Italy. Comparisons of R-ST and F-ST suggest that stepwise mutation has contributed to differentiation between island and continental populations (France/UK and China/Japan) and also among distant samples. However, pairwise R-ST values between distant populations appear to be unreliable, probably due to size homoplasy. Our findings also highlight two priorities for conservation. First, stronger genetic subdivision within the UK than across 4000 km of continental Eurasia is most likely the result of population fragmentation and highlights the need to maintain gene flow in this species. Second, deep splits within China and between Europe and China are indicative of cryptic taxonomic divisions which need further investigation.},

abstract = {Female greater horseshoe bats form maternity colonies each summer in order to give birth and raise young. During the mating period, females visit males occupying territorial sites, copulation takes place and sperm are stored until ovulation occurs, normally in April. Using microsatellite markers and a likelihood method of parentage analysis, we studied breeding behaviour and male reproductive success over a five-year period in a population of bats in south-west Britain. Paternity was assigned with 80% confidence to 44% of young born in five successive cohorts. While a small annual skew in male reproductive success was detected, the variance increased over five years due to the repeated success of a few individuals. Mating was polygynous, although some females gave birth to offspring sired by the same male in separate years. Such repeated partnerships probably result from fidelity for either mating sites or individuals or from sperm competition. Females mated with males born both within and outside their own natal colony; however, relatedness between parents was no less than the average recorded for male-female pairs. Gene flow between colonies is likely to be primarily mediated by both female and male dispersal during the mating period rather than more permanent movements.},

abstract = {The factors influencing the survival of greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) offspring born over seven years at a maternity colony in south-west Britain were studied. The effects of a range of phenotypic and maternal variables were analysed using a historical data set. In addition, the influence of two genetic measures on mortality, individual heterozygosity and a new measure of outbreeding, termed mean d(2), was assessed. Logistic regressions were undertaken with survival modelled as a binary response variable. Survival to two life stages was studied for each variable and all models were developed for both sexes separately and together. Only one variable, mean d(2), was significantly associated with survival. Male offspring with high mean d(2) scores were more likely to survive to their first and second summers. The influence of mean d(2) was not due to a single locus under selection but a wider multilocus effect and probably represents heterosis as opposed to solely inbreeding depression. Therefore, the extent to which an individual is outbred may determine survival more than widely used phenotypic characteristics such as size and mass. Mean d(2) may reflect immunocompetence, which influences mortality Protection of mating sites in order to facilitate gene flow and, therefore, outbreeding may help to promote population stability and growth.},

abstract = {Female greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) exhibit strong natal philopatry to their maternity roost over many years, leading to the aggregation of matrilineal kin. Maternity colonies may, therefore, be expected to comprise highly related individuals, and, as such, provide conditions suitable for the evolution of kin-selected behaviours. To test these predictions, we examined relatedness and behaviour among matrilineal kin within a colony in south-west Britain. Genetic analysis of 15 matrilines, identified from microsatellite genotyping and long-term ringing surveys, revealed average relatedness levels of 0.17 to 0.64. In contrast, background relatedness among colony females approximated to zero (0.03). These results suggest that inclusive fitness benefits may only be accrued through discriminate cooperation within matrilines, and not at the wider colony level. To examine whether the potential for such benefits is realised through kin- biased cooperation during foraging, females from two matrilines were radiotracked simultaneously over 3 years. Pairwise homerange overlap correlated significantly with Hamilton's relatedness coefficient. The greatest spatial associations were observed between females and their adult daughters, which shared both foraging grounds and night roosts, sometimes over several years. Tagged females, however, generally foraged and roosted alone, suggesting that kin-biased spatial association probably does not result from either information-transfer or cooperative territorial defence. Such patterns may instead result from a mechanism of maternal inheritance of preferred foraging and roosting sites.},

To examine the consequences of fragmentation and limited dispersal on patterns of genetic structure and variation, we used microsatellite markers to screen bats from around 50% of the known maternity colonies in Britain, and two areas from continental Europe. Analyses revealed that Welsh and English colonies were genetically isolated. This, and lower variability in Britain than north France, may result from either genetic drift, or the species' colonization history. Gene now among most neighbouring colonies was not generally restricted, with one exception. These findings have important implications for the ongoing conservation management of this species.},

Mink were also controlled in South Harris to prevent reinvasion. 532 mink were removed, and no further animals were caught or recorded in the eradication area in the last six months of the project. The entire archipelago is now being trapped using techniques developed from the pilot phase. The programme used an adaptive approach, learning as the project proceeded. The lessons learned were also applied to two other scenarios. These included the Isle of Mull, where with limited resources, trapping is carried out by volunteers, and the development of a national management plan in Ireland, where the species is widespread and farmed. The strategies and techniques developed in the Hebrides were modified to fit these differing scenarios. These are discussed together with an exploration of how we can increase our capacity to manage the species over larger landscape scales.},

abstract = {Since escaping from fur farms in the 1950s, American mink had colonised the 2800 km(2) archipelago of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. Between November 2001 and June 2006 the species was removed from a total of 850 km(2) of the southernmost islands, collectively named the Uists, as part of a pilot study exploring the feasibility of large scale eradication throughout the archipelago. Animals were also controlled in neighbouring South Harris (255 km(2)) to reduce the risk of recolonisation. The project used two main methods, the operation of coastal and riparian cage traps; and trapping at breeding dens located using trained dogs. In the Uists this resulted in 100,824 trap nights over 4 years. Den searches were carried out over 500 handler-days. Overall a total of 228 mink was caught in The Uists, with the last capture in March 2005. After this date, despite a further 7 months of intensive trapping and searching effort, no further signs of mink were found and they were considered likely to have been removed from this region. In the buffer area of South Harris, 41,674 trap nights over 4 years resulted in 240 captures with few animals being caught by the end of the project. This effort greatly reduced the risk of recolonisation from this region, although there was still a possibility of extant isolated populations remaining within the region, particularly on offshore islets, which would then be detected and trapped by a follow up programme. An adaptive management process resulted in significant increases in trapping efficiency. Improvements included optimisation of trap spacing and the frequency and duration of trap-line operation; improvements in the cage designs and use of lures. The protocols developed here were used in the subsequent eradication campaign in the remainder of the Outer Hebrides.},

abstract = {Wild boar, Sus scrofa have been extinct in the wild in Britain for about 300 years. However, escapees from farm enclosures have been noted for over 20 years in parts of Southeast England, and populations of free-living feral boar have now established. Boar root for food on the woodland ground where hazel dormice, Muscardinus avellanarius hibernate in fragile nests and thus may impact on their population through predation. A group of twelve woodland sites assessed as suitable for supporting dormice and where wild populations of boar were known to have been present for ca. 20 years were chosen in Sussex (boar-positive sites). An additional twelve sites without boar presence (boar-negative) were chosen in the same region from the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme (NDMP). Fifty nest boxes were erected in early spring 2009 at each new site and all were inspected in June and October until the end of 2012. The numbers of individual dormice, empty nests found, and nest boxes used by dormice annually were compared between the two groups. The correlative GLM comparisons (using a negative binomial model) for all three indices were significantly higher in the boar-negative sites, suggesting that boar have negatively impacted on, but not eliminated, dormouse populations. Potential confounding variables including soils and woodland classification were investigated and were similar between the groups. Since the study was over a four year period any initial neophobic reaction to new nest boxes on the boar-positive sites would be unlikely to influence the result. We had no data for boar densities so could not evaluate boar versus dormouse density.},

abstract = {Grazing-induced changes in plant quality have been suggested to drive the negative delayed density dependence exhibited by many herbivore species, but little field evidence exists to support this hypothesis. We tested a key premise of the hypothesis that reciprocal feedback between vole grazing pressure and the induction of anti-herbivore silicon defenses in grasses drives observed population cycles in a large-scale field experiment in northern England. We repeatedly reduced population densities of field voles (Microtus agrestis) on replicated 1-ha grassland plots at Kielder Forest, northern England, over a period of 1year. Subsequently, we tested for the impact of past density on vole life history traits in spring, and whether these effects were driven by induced silicon defenses in the voles' major over-winter food, the grass Deschampsia caespitosa. After several months of density manipulation, leaf silicon concentrations diverged and averaged 22% lower on sites where vole density had been reduced, but this difference did not persist beyond the period of the density manipulations. There were no significant effects of our density manipulations on vole body mass, spring population growth rate, or mean date for the onset of spring reproduction the following year. These findings show that grazing by field voles does induce increased silicon defenses in grasses at a landscape scale. However, at the vole densities encountered, levels of plant damage appear to be below those needed to induce changes in silicon levels large and persistent enough to affect vole performance, confirming the threshold effects we have previously observed in laboratory-based studies. Our findings do not support the plant quality hypothesis for observed vole population cycles in northern England, at least over the range of vole densities that now prevail here.},

abstract = {1. The decline of the water vole Arvicola terrestris in the UK has been attributed to the spread of the introduced American mink Mustela vison. Understanding the causes and dynamics of this decline is vital to water vole conservation. We investigated the dynamics of water voles in relation to habitat fragmentation and mink predation using an individual-based spatially explicit model of population dynamics on the River Windrush, Oxfordshire, UK. 2. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken using values for life-history parameters drawn from known ranges using Latin hypercube sampling. Partial correlation coefficients were used to estimate how the predicted size of water vole population and extinction were determined by the life-history parameters. The model was then validated by comparing model predictions with observed distributions of water voles. 3. The effects of mink predation and habitat fragmentation on the future viability of water vole populations on the River Windrush were analysed after artificially manipulating habitat fragmentation on the river and running the model in the presence and absence of mink predation. 4. The match between predicted and observed distributions was significantly related to home range requirement and high reproductive success. At low fragmentation, home range requirement was the most important influence on the number of populations. Reproductive output, and adult and juvenile mortality, became increasingly important with increased fragmentation. At high levels of fragmentation demographic stochasticity had a large influence on population size. 5. We deduce that the importance of demography in determining population persistence will depend on the level of fragmentation. Additionally, life-history parameters that are crucial to the viability of water vole populations can only be identified in the context of the landscape in which populations are found. 6. The extinction of water vole on the River Windrush became more likely as habitat fragmentation and mink predation increased. Mink predation effectively doubled the probability of extinction over that arising from fragmentation alone. 7. These simulations indicate that extant populations on the Windrush are now so fragmented that populations may not be viable even in the absence of mink predation. We assessed the extent of habitat restoration necessary to ensure population persistence on the River Windrush and considered developments of the model for use in water vole conservation.},

We used a spatially explicit population dynamics model to investigate the changes of red and gray squirrel Populations in landscapes to assess the effects of gray squirrel population control methods on red squirrel Population viability. We analyzed 2 methods of gray squirrel Population control: (1) trapping where adults were killed on an annual basis, and (2) immunocontraception where reproduction was suppressed. The model was run tinder a range of efficiency and intensity of control as well as red and gray squirrel life-history scenarios created by Latin Hypercube Sampling of the realistic parameter range for both demographic and control variables. The viability of squirrel populations in 2 contrasting landscape scenarios was investigated: (1) Thetford Forest, East Anglia, United Kingdom (UK), where a small isolated population of red squirrels is surrounded by a large population of gray squirrels; and (2) Redesdale Forest, Northumberland, UK, where red squirrels are still in abundance and the first gray squirrels were observed to disperse into the area from Scotland. In the absence of population control of gray squirrels, red squirrel populations were predicted to become extinct in both landscapes within 15 years at Thetford and 6 years at Redesdale. Immunocontraception did not lead to persistent populations at Thetford but allowed red squirrels to persist in Redesdale. Removal of gray squirrels by trapping at both sites was predicted to lead to red squirrel population persistence. Our findings suggest that immunocontraception is unlikely to be effective unless it is applied to a large portion of the target and surrounding population. Our results also indicate that an integrated control strategy, incorporating both trapping and immunocontraception, may be the best option for controlling gray squirrels. This integrated strategy needs to include the relative costs of control, and it may be that immunocontraception provides the best overall solution in areas where gray squirrels are low in abundance.},

The presence/absence of red squirrels in habitat blocks in the landscape was used as the dependent variable and the size and separation of habitat blocks as independent variables in the GLM analysis. Red squirrel presence within a woodland was significantly related to woodland size and the distance to the nearest wood known to contain squirrels. The SEPM-generated predictions on population viability were closest to the field data when a low dispersal distance of 1 km was used. This suggests that squirrel dispersal on the Isle of Wight is restricted. Our results suggest that some large interconnected woodlands should be maintained if red squirrels are to be conserved for the future.},

abstract = {Understanding how culling practices impact target populations is essential in identifying optimum strategies for controlling population size. Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) populations are subject to attempted control throughout much of their range due to their impacts on livestock and game, and disease transmission (e.g., rabies); however, the efficacy of different methods in controlling fox populations is low. For mesomammal species, experimental approaches are often limited by issues of scale. We used an individual-based, spatially explicit population model to investigate the efficacy of different culling practices in artificial landscapes. Model outputs were the number of social groups, the fox population before and after breeding, the extent of successful dispersal within the landscape, and the number of migrants out of the landscape. We investigated 4 different population management strategies using our model: 1) hunting with hounds, 2) winter shooting, 3) culling at the den in spring, and 4) fertility control. Population density in the absence of control was most strongly related to carrying capacity and the extent of immigration from surrounding fox populations. Culling at the den was most successful at suppressing fox populations, while fertility control was least effective, but the effect depended on the carrying capacity of the landscape. We conclude that effective control of populations at landscape scales (e.g., 1, 600 km(2)) is not feasible or practical unless immigration from outside populations is low or can be controlled. These results can be used to inform policy on the management of United Kingdom (UK) fox populations and contribute to the ongoing debate on hunting with hounds as practiced in the UK.},

abstract = {Distress calls were recorded from three sympatric species of pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus nathusii, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus) in England and Northern Ireland. At foraging sites, we conducted playback experiments, consisting of experimental distress call sequences from each species and control sequences of random noise and sound recorded with no bats present. We measured response by simultaneously recording ultrasound during playbacks and counting the echolocation pulses above a predetermined threshold which were then identified to species. All three species responded to each other's calls. The number of recorded echolocation pulses of all species increased eight-fold, on average, during the playback of distress call sequences compared with the playback of ultrasonic noise, and four-fold compared with the playback of silence. In a separate playback experiment, the number of echolocation pulses of P. pygmaeus increased 14-fold during the playback of distress calls of four endemic species of bat from Madagascar (Emballonura atrata, Myotis goudoti, Miniopterus majori and M. manavi) compared with the playback of silence. This increased response might have been caused by the high calling rates of the Malagasy species. Distress calls of P. nathusii, P. pipistrellus and P. pygmaeus were structurally convergent, consisting of a series of downward-sweeping, frequency-modulated elements of short duration and high intensity with a relatively strong harmonic content. Selection may favour convergence in the structure of distress calls among bat species, if attracting heterospecifics increases the chance of repelling predators by mobbing.

To measure the bats' response, in terms of variation in the number of echolocation. pulses, we simultaneously recorded ultrasound during playbacks and counted the echolocation pulses. Significantly more echolocation pulses were recorded during playback of the base call than during playback of control sounds and responses to modified base calls indicated that the interelement interval, element duration and consecutive element frequency may be important for distress call recognition. Changes to the interelement interval, consecutive element frequency and bandwidth may convey information about the affective state of the sender.},

The river Dee, which is fed by mountain streams and bordered by woodland for much of its length, and the river Ythan, which drains farmland and is bordered mostly by treeless fields and pastures, did not differ significantly in foraging bat density. Likewise, bat density over the water did not differ between treeless and wooded parts of the rivers, and was not influenced by the presence of bridges. However, bridges were probably used as mating stations by pipistrelles, as indicated by the high incidence of low frequency calls in autumn. The result extends previous knowledge by revealing the importance of the river, rather than the riparian vegetation, as feeding habitat for two of the three common bat species in Scotland.},

pages = {243-252},
abstract = {The flight activity of three species of insectivorous bats and their prey was studied in north-east Scotland (57 degrees N) during summer 1993. Aerial insects of sizes taken by bats were more abundant during the day than during the night, but the highest abundance usually occurred around dusk, partly reflecting increased flight of dipterans. In contrast, the flight activity of moths, mainly Geometridae and Pyralidae, was greatest around midnight. Two species of aerial-hawking bats, Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Myotis daubentonii, which feed primarily on small flying insects, mainly Diptera, emerged from their roosts 15-30 min after sunset, during or after the dusk peak in insect activity, and subsequently foraged as their food was declining in abundance. In contrast, the foliage gleaning bat Plecotus auritus, which feeds primarily on moths, did not emerge until about one hour after sunset, but while the activity of its main prey was increasing. The two aerial-hawking bats therefore seem to be constrained from exploiting most of the evening peak in aerial insect abundance, presumably because earlier emergence would result in higher predation risk at the higher light levels. P. auritus may have less to gain by emerging early, since it can feed on moths and non-flying prey independently of the activity of small insects at dusk. The conclusions have implications for the conservation of bats and their habitats particularly at high latitudes. Protective tree cover may allow earlier evening emergence of bats and therefore provide access to more food.},

In January 1996, 30 exclosures of 2 X 2 x 1.5 in and 30 paired controls were set up. Measurements of vegetation density at six height categories using a cover board were taken in late winter and mid-summer in each of the four years 1996-1999. Mean cover values were calculated for each woodland, and they indicated that the density of vegetative cover was reduced by deer browsing in winter and in summer. The effect of the browsing increased significantly within the four-year study period, and plant species composition had changed by the end of the study period. Our results suggest that roe deer may be having a substantial and potentially widespread effect on vegetative structure and composition in small farm woodlands in arable ecosystems in central southern England. The implications of this, for the characteristic wildlife and game species found in this common woodland habitat, are discussed.},

abstract = {The squirrel poxvirus (SQPV) is the probable mediator of apparent competition between the introduced invading gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) and the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) in the UK, and modeling studies have shown that this viral disease has had a significant impact on the decline of the red squirrel in the UK. However, given our limited understanding of the epidemiology of the disease, and more generally the effects of invasive species on parasite ecology, there is a need to investigate the transmission dynamics and the relative pathogenicity of the virus between species. We aimed to increase our knowledge of these processes through an empirical study in which we: (i) used pathological signs and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to diagnose SQPV disease in red squirrels found dead during scanning surveillance between 1993 and 2005; (ii) detected antibody to SQPV using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the same animals; and (iii) mapped cases of the disease, and the gray squirrel distribution, using a geographical information system. We analyzed the distribution of cases of SQPV disease according to woodland type, a measure of squirrel density. SQPV disease occurred only in areas of England also inhabited by seropositive gray squirrels, and as the geographical range of gray squirrels expanded, SQPV disease occurred in these new gray squirrel habitats, supporting a role for the gray squirrel as a reservoir host of the virus. There was a delay between the establishment of invading gray squirrels and cases of the disease in red squirrels which implies gray squirrels must reach a threshold number or density before the virus is transmitted to red squirrels. The spatial and temporal trend in SQPV disease outbreaks suggested that SQPV disease will have a significant effect on Scottish populations of red squirrels within 25 years. The even spread of cases of disease across months suggested a direct rather than vector-borne transmission route is more likely. Eight juvenile and sub-adult free-living red squirrels apparently survived exposure to SQPV by mounting an immune response, the first evidence of immunity to SQPV in free-living red squirrels, which possibly suggests a changing host-parasite relationship and that the use of a vaccine may be an effective management tool to protect remnant red squirrel populations.},

A direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the measurement of antibody to squirrel parapoxvirus. We tested 140 sera from red squirrels and 223 from grey squirrels from different populations in the UK. A high percentage (61%) of apparently healthy grey squirrels, were found to have been exposed to the parapoxvirus. Only 2.86% (4/140) of red squirrels had antibody and three of these animals had parapoxvirus-associated disease. We postulate that the grey squirrel may act as a reservoir host for the virus.},

abstract = {After historical declines in population sizes and ranges, we compare and contrast the recent history and contemporary variation in the status of Great Britain's eight native mammalian carnivore species from the 1960s to 2017. Wildcat Felis silvestris conservation status is unfavourable and is masked by hybridisation with domestic cats Felis catus. Red foxes Vulpes vulpes remain widespread but are currently declining. European otter Lutra lutra, European pine marten Martes martes and European polecat Mustela putorius populations are characterised by rapid recovery. Otters have almost completely recolonised Great Britain, polecats have expanded their range throughout southern Britain from refugia in Wales and pine martens have expanded their range from the Scottish Highlands. European badgers Meles meles have generally increased in population density. Status assessments of stoats Mustela erminea and weasels Mustela nivalis are data-deficient but available evidence suggests that stoats may have increased while weasels may have declined. Anthropogenic processes influencing carnivore status include legal protections, habitat quality, reintroductions, predator control, pollutants, hybridisation and diseases and their associated control practices. Population effects of contaminants, such as anticoagulant rodenticides, remain poorly characterised. The widespread interface with domestic and feral cats makes the wildcat's situation precarious. Recent declines in rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus populations are a concern, given that several carnivore species depend on them as food. We conclude that, with the exception of the wildcat, the status of Great Britain's mammalian carnivores has markedly improved since the 1960s. Better understanding of the social aspects of interactions between humans and expanding predator populations is needed if conflict is to be avoided and long-term co-existence with people is to be possible.},

pages = {181-190},
abstract = {Following nineteenth-century declines, polecats Mustela putorius are recolonising Great Britain. Polecat diet relates to two potential risks to recovery. First, rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus, which are important prey for polecats, have experienced extreme population fluctuations, with near extirpation due to myxomatosis in the 1950s, recovery in 1960s-1990s and declines in 1990s-2010s. Second, polecats are secondarily exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides by eating contaminated rodents, and the frequency of polecat exposure to rodenticides is increasing. We analysed stomach contents from 99 polecats collected in 2012-2016 and compared results with earlier studies. Lagomorphs were the most abundant prey (66% frequency of occurrence, 95% confidence interval 53-74%), followed by other mammals (12%, 4-18%), amphibians (10%, 3-16%) and birds (7%, 1-13%). Diet varied seasonally; lagomorph occurrence was highest in spring and summer and lowest in autumn. Dietary niche breadth was greater in the 1960s, when rabbits were scarce, than in other decades, but did not differ between the 1990s and 2010s, indicating that diets have not diversified with recent rabbit declines. This may be because rabbit abundance is not yet low enough to cause dietary diversification or because polecats were collected in areas where rabbits were still abundant. Rodents did not increase in diet between the 1990s and 2010s and still occur with < 10% frequency, indicating that rodents need not contribute much to diet to expose polecats to rodenticides. This potentially limits the effectiveness of management actions designed to minimise polecat exposure to contaminated rodent prey.},

abstract = {Rewilding is emerging as a promising framework within restoration ecology to help restore ecosystem function through species reintroduction. To manage effectively such projects it is necessary to predict and quantify the interactions between the reintroduced species and their environment. To date, this has not been a priority in restoration ecology. Here, we quantify wild boar's rooting rate at a range of stocking densities to explore their potential to aid the restoration of the Caledonian pine forest in the Scottish Highlands by reinvigorating the disturbance regime. Eleven enclosures of c. 0.5ha within heather moorland, dominated by Caluna vulgaris, were used, situated on the Alladale Wilderness Reserve, 50km north-west of Inverness. Stocking densities varied between 4 and 15 boar/ha. The accumulation of rooted area was recorded weekly over a 13-week period. A cost analysis was performed to compare the use of wild boar with other ground preparation techniques. The median per capita rooting rate was 42.4m2/week (interquartile range [IQR] 45.5), but rooting rate varied temporally. Median rooting rates varied between 21.6 and 75.3m2/week (IQR 5.6) in periods that varied in suitability for rooting. Rooting rates were consistent across stocking densities. The cost of using wild boar as a ground preparation tool ranged between 184 pound and 1,961 pound per hectare depending on stocking density and rate of rooting. This experiment has direct application for managing the impact of wild boar within free range farming conditions, managed woodland regeneration schemes, rewilding projects, and in the wild.},

abstract = {Ecosystem engineers are increasingly being reintroduced to restore ecological processes in restoration and rewilding projects. To predict and adaptively manage the impact of such species their behavioral ecology must be understood and quantified. Rooting behavior by wild boar qualifies them as ecosystem engineers due to their impact on vegetation disturbance regimes. The behavioral foraging ecology of wild boar was quantified in a fenced area in the Scottish Highlands in order to provide some of the understanding necessary to predict their ability to affect ecosystem restoration. Five wild boar were monitored within a 125ha fenced area using Global Positioning System (GPS) collars and behavioral monitoring over a 12-month period. Their activity budget, the relationship between foraging behavior and vegetation communities, and how these relationships vary between seasons was investigated. The results indicate that wild boar invested approximately four more hours daily to rooting during the autumn and winter than the spring and summer. During the spring and summer, grazing was the dominant foraging behavior (approximately 28% of foraging period) while rooting dominated in autumn and winter (approximately 76% of foraging period). Deep rooting behavior is particularly associated with bracken-dominated communities. Associations between rooting, vegetation community, and season will have a strong influence on the spatial and temporal distribution of rooting behavior. This variation could have important implications for the impacts of boar on vegetation community dynamics. These results detail some of wild boar's ecosystem engineering behaviors; however, further research is required to consider the wider impacts of a full reintroduction.},

abstract = {The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the principal vector of rabies in Western Europe, and the high density of foxes in many British cities is therefore of particular concern. Contingency plans for the control of rabies in urban areas in Britain are focused on the use of poison baits to control the fox population, but field trials have so far achieved bait uptake rates which fall far short of those required. It is possible that greater uptake rates and hence improved efficiency of control could be achieved by targeting the baits more effectively towards preferred fox habitats. To help move towards this goal, we quantified the habitat preferences of urban foxes living in Bristol, England using compositional analysis. Time spent and distance travelled by individuals within different habitats, as revealed by radio tracking, were used as indicators of habitat preference during bouts of activity, and the frequency of lying-up sites was used as an indicator of habitat preference during periods of day rime inactivity. Five habitat groupings were considered in the analysis: (1) back gardens, (2) front gardens and common gardens, (3) playing fields, parklands, churchyards and cemeteries, (4) roads, verges, shops and commercial centres, and (5) woodlands, rough ground and allotment gardens. Back gardens, woodland, rough ground and allotment gardens were the most heavily used habitats in terms of both time spent and distance moved by foxes. These habitats were also most favoured for day-time lying-up sites. The results are discussed with reference to their potential implications for bait uptake and rabies control.},

abstract = {We tested the hypothesis that low-ranking red deer Cervus elaphus stags adjust feeding tactics according to the spatio-temporal availability of the food. We observed free-ranging red deer at two supplementary feeding sites in the Scottish Highlands. It was predicted that at spatially clumped food, low-ranking stags would avoid high-ranking stags, 1. spatially when food is available only for a short period, but 2. temporally when the food is available continuously. We observed several feeding tactics in low-ranking stags and the prevalence of a feeding tactic was related to the spatial distribution of the food. When food was highly clumped some low-ranking stags rushed in between feeding high-ranking stags, took a bite and retreated to process the bite (sneaking tactic). Bite rate/min did not differ between sneaking (0.29 +/- 0.05) and non-sneaking low-ranking stags (0.26 +/- 0.05). Compared with non-sneaking low-ranking herd members, sneaking stags took larger bites, as reflected in a significantly longer handling time (125 +/- 12.4 s/bite) and thus achieved a higher intake, although still considerably less than high-ranking stags. The temporal availability of the food did not influence feeding tactics in low-ranking stags. Low-ranking stags always avoided higher-ranking herd members spatially but did not shift their feeding bouts to times of the day when high-ranking stags were not feeding.},

abstract = {For group-foraging ungulates, forage is generally widely and relatively evenly dis persed. However, for free-ranging red deer Cervus elaphus supplementary winter feeding provides distinct patches of predictable food. These patches differ in size, but also in temporal distribution and depletion rate. Interference competition is known to increase with increasing spatial clumping (decreasing patch size), but the influence of temporal clumping and the predictability of food occurrence has received much less attention. Therefore in this study we investigated the effects of different degrees of spatial and temporal clumping of food on interference competition during feeding. Patch size was the main parameter influencing participation in feeding as well as interference competition during feeding on the respective patch. Temporal dispersion and the predictability of food occurrence were however, important parameters for the timing of aggressive interactions. Generally, aggression occurs during feeding and increases with decreasing patch size. But when depletion rate was high, food availability was predictably short and the patch occurred predictably (such as hay), middle ranking stags increased aggression already prior to feeding at the respective patch. We suggest that in this way they confirmed hierarchy outside feeding on the quickly depleted patch and as a result gained actual feeding time when feeding on the respective patch. With the patch occurring predictably but varying in size, the number of participating subordinates varied concomitantly with variation in patch size. Subordinates assessed patch profitability and left without having fed when patch size was too small for an efficient participation. When patch size was predictably small enough to be defended exclusively (feed blocks), subordinate stags did not assess profitability each time but did not participate at all in feeding at the respective patch. The relative importance of these various food-related parameters (patch size, depletion rate, predictability) influencing feeding competition and the timing of aggression will vary with group size, rank, alternative food sources, physical characteristics of the food as well as different hierarchy systems of the feeding animals.},

journal = {Oecologia},
volume = {127},
number = {2},
pages = {191-197},
abstract = {In red deer, yearling antler length is a largely nutrition-mediated phenotypic character, and is therefore sometimes used as an indirect estimate of range quality and population condition. However, the parameters affecting yearling antler length have been little studied. We analyse the contributions of density, weather and maternal effects on yearling antler length of 581 individual stags born 1970-1996 on the Isle of Rum (Scotland). We show that antler length is a good measure of yearling condition: the probability of overwinter survival in yearlings that developed antlers was 3 times higher than for yearlings that did not develop antlers, and yearling antler length was correlated with the number of antler points the following year. Between years, variation in yearling antler length was best explained by variation in red deer density and June temperature at 12 months of age. Both of these variables were negatively correlated with antler length, and most likely this effect is due to changes in nutrient availability. Population density affects biomass availability for the individual, while low temperatures in early summer prolong the availability of high forage quality. At the individual level, antler length increased with birth weight and decreased with birth date, reflecting the persistent and pervasive influence of conditions in early life.},

abstract = {The control of grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) is widely undertaken as a conservation measure to protect red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) populations in the UK. However, inconsistencies and omissions in data collection, as well as fluctuating financial resourcing of control efforts, have meant that it has to date proved difficult to quantify the impact of any regional control initiative upon populations. Here we have scrutinized a 13 years period (1998-2010) within an ongoing grey squirrel control project that reflects the resource challenges typically faced by red squirrel conservation programmes. We present evidence that despite variation in grey squirrel control intensity, the abundance of grey squirrels ultimately decreased significantly. Trapping success was significantly higher in spring and summer months and a greater abundance of grey squirrels was found in deciduous woodland and hazel dominated scrub relative to other habitats; two findings that reinforce existing guidance within national control best practice. Grey squirrels carry an infection that causes epidemic pathogenic disease if spread to the native red squirrel. We observed that the proportion of seropositive grey squirrels decreased constantly from 2003 to 2010 when only 4 % of sampled animals were seropositive. This discovery indicates that culling can in parallel remove both the competitive and disease threat posed to red by grey squirrels. The historical paucity of scientific data on the effectiveness of grey squirrel control as a tactic in UK red squirrel conservation means that the findings of this study will significantly advance conservation best practice and inform the development of future national strategy.},

journal = {Urban Ecosystems},
pages = {14},
abstract = {Urban areas may support high densities of wild carnivores, and pathogens can strongly influence carnivore populations. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are hosts of sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei), which infects numerous species, and transmission can be density dependent. In Great Britain, urban red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have recently increased in population density and undergone range expansions. Here we investigate corresponding changes in urban fox mange prevalence. We predicted a higher prevalence closer to historic epi/enzootics and lower prevalence where urban features reduce fox density and movements, i.e. large areas of public green space, and fragmented habitat, as measured by road length and urban perimeter shape complexity. We visually assessed mange symptoms from georeferenced images of urban foxes submitted online by the public, thus surveying private land on a national scale. We measured the proportion of foxes apparently showing mange and used SATSCAN to identify spatial clusters of high infection risk. Landscape features were extracted from urban layers in GIS to determine associations. Although mange was widespread, we identified a single cluster of high prevalence (37.1%) in Northwest and Central England, which exceeded double mean prevalence overall (15.1%) and mirrors the northward expansion of urban fox distribution. Prevalence was positively correlated with perimeter shape complexity and negatively correlated with distance to the nearest city with mange, although the latter association was weak. Our findings show that citizen science can effectively monitor diseases with highly visible symptoms and suggest that fox movements are influential in explaining spatial patterns of prevalence.},

abstract = {The Eurasian water shrew Neomys fodiens is a semi-aquatic predator of freshwater invertebrates. As water quality affects the diversity and abundance of aquatic invertebrates, water shrews could potentially be used as a vertebrate bio-indicator of water quality. To date, no detailed studies have empirically examined the impacts of water quality on Eurasian water shrew occurrence. Bait-tube surveys were undertaken in winter and summer over 3 years at 26 different wetland locations across Sussex, UK, which varied in water quality. Bait tubes were used to confirm water shrew presence at specific sites and derive an index of activity using frequency of occurrence of faeces within tubes. Water quality was measured using six direct physical and chemical indicators (dissolved oxygen, pH, water temperature, ammonia, nitrate and phosphate) and two derived indices of biological indicators based on aquatic invertebrate composition. We found no linear relationship between any physical, chemical or biological water quality indicators and water shrew occurrence. Generalized linear models indicate that water shrew presence and frequency of occurrence are more affected by site and season than water quality. Thus, water shrews may be more tolerant of poor water quality than previously envisaged. Overall, our study indicates that water shrews are not suitable vertebrate bio-indicators of water quality.},

abstract = {A naturally functioning riparian zone is essential for the ecological health of a river, filtering pollutants, supplying organic matter and providing a structural habitat for wildlife. Most lowland rivers would also naturally flood the riparian zone at regular intervals, thereby providing direct inputs of nutrients and water that create additional habitats and breeding opportunities for riverine species. We examined the relationship between the quality of the riparian habitat and foraging and activity of bats (Chiroptera), which are good indicators of ecosystem health. Twenty paired sites in the Rivers Lee and Colne catchments in England were selected to test the hypothesis that degradation in the quality of riparian habitat reduces foraging and activity in bats; paired sites were similar in terms of size, flow rate and water chemistry but differed in the quality of their riparian zones. AnaBat detectors were used to measure bat activity from 30 min before dusk to 30 min after sunrise on the same night at paired sites because recording frequency-divided bat echolocation calls in real time allows large amounts of data to be collected over long time periods in a digitized format. Significantly more feeding buzzes were recorded in sites with better quality riparian zones; no differences in overall bat activity were found between the two habitat types. Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus accounted for 96% of bat passes. Pipistrellus pygmaeus was significantly more active in high quality sites than P. pipistrellus; there was no difference between the two species in poor quality sites. We show that the quality of riparian buffer zones is important for the activity and feeding behaviour of pipistrelle bats.},

abstract = {Many temperate insectivorous bats show marked sexual segregation during the summer, but in spectacular, pre-hibernation swarming, gather at caves to mate. In many species, sexual segregation is probably due to a gradient in aerial insect availability that confines females to lower elevations, where high reproductive costs are met by an abundant and reliable food supply. In the hawking and trawling Myotis daubentonii, we show that alongside inter-sexual segregation, there is intra-male segregation and suggest that this results from the exclusion of most males from high-quality habitat. These apparently excluded males suffer reduced foraging efficiency and mating success relative to males that roost with the females in summer. Changes in resources and behaviour at the end of the summer lead to a change in strategy that gives all males a chance to mate during swarming, but this does not overcome the paternity advantage to males that spend the summer with the females.},

abstract = {Red foxes Vulpes vulpes were observed foraging in sites occupied by nesting waders and waterfowl in the Lower Derwent Valley in northern England. The data obtained were used to parameterise an individual-based simulation model of fox search behaviour, which was used to explore the sensitivity of nest encounter rates to changes of search area between 1 and 10 ha. The model predicted that nests in larger patches will have a much greater chance of surviving predation than nests in smaller patches for realistic foraging effort, assuming that the search time is equal in all patches. This qualitative result remained the same for a range of realistic nest detection efficiencies and movement parameters. Patch size was also shown to be important when the assumption of equal search effort between patches was relaxed. When foxes were assumed to search systematically in a zigzag path along strip habitats, nest predation risk was shown to be sensitive to changes in habitat width of a few metres, provided the habitats were long enough (more than similar to8 km). The implications for predation management and new research on fox behaviour are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The dis-equilibrium caused by non-native species introductions has revealed that the outcome of such indirect interactions can often be dramatic. However, studies of enemy-mediated competition mostly consider the impact of a single enemy, despite species being embedded in complex networks of interactions. Here, we demonstrate that native red and invasive grey squirrels in Britain, two terrestrial species linked by resource and disease-mediated apparent competition, are also now linked by a second enemy-mediated relationship involving a shared native predator recovering from historical persecution, the European pine marten. Through combining spatial capture-recapture techniques to estimate pine marten density, and squirrel site-occupancy data, we find that the impact of exposure to predation is highly asymmetrical, with non-native grey squirrel occupancy strongly negatively affected by exposure to pine martens. By contrast, exposure to pine marten predation has an indirect positive effect on red squirrel populations. Pine marten predation thus reverses the well-documented outcome of resource and apparent competition between red and grey squirrels.},

pages = {327-334},
abstract = {The vast majority of models for spatial dynamics of natural populations assume a homogeneous physical environment. However, in practice, dispersing organisms may encounter landscape features that significantly inhibit their movement. We use mathematical modelling to investigate the effect of such landscape features on cyclic predator-prey populations. We show that when appropriate boundary conditions are applied at the edge of the obstacle, a pattern of periodic travelling waves develops, moving out and away from the obstacle. Depending on the assumptions of the model, these waves can take the form of roughly circular 'target patterns' or spirals. This is, to our knowledge, a new mechanism for periodic-wave generation in ecological systems and our results suggest that it may apply quite generally not only to cyclic predator-prey interactions, but also to populations that oscillate for other reasons. In particular, we suggest that it may provide an explanation for the observed pattern of travelling waves in the densities of field voles (Microtus agrestis) in Kielder Forest (Scotland-England border) and of red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) on Kerloch Moor (northeast Scotland), which in both cases move orthogonally to any large-scale obstacles to movement. Moreover, given that such obstacles to movement are the rule rather than the exception in real-world environments, our results suggest that complex spatio-temporal patterns such as periodic travelling waves are likely to be much more common in the natural world than has previously been assumed.},

journal = {Journal of Applied Ecology},
volume = {37},
pages = {148-158},
abstract = {1. Earlier studies have reported that field vole Microtus agrestis populations in Kielder Forest, UK, exhibit typical 3-4-year cyclical dynamics, and that the observed spatiotemporal patterns are consistent with a travelling wave in vole abundance moving along an axis south-west-north-east at approximately 19 km year(-1). One property of this wave is that nearby populations fluctuate more synchronously than distant ones, with correlations falling lower than the average for the sampling area beyond approximately 13 km. 2. In this paper we present a series of models that investigate the possibility that both the observed degree of synchrony and the travelling wave call be explained as a simple consequence of linking a series of otherwise independently oscillating populations. Our 'coupled oscillator' models consider a series of populations, distributed either in a linear array or in a two-dimensional regular matrix. Local population fluctuations, each with a 3-4-year period, were generated using either a Ricker equation or a set of discrete-time Lotka-Volterra equations. Movement among populations was simulated either by a fixed proportion of each population moving locally to their nearest neighbour populations, or the same proportion being distributed via a continuous geometric function (more distant populations receiving less). 3. For a variety of different ways of generating cycles and a number of different movement rules, local exchange between oscillating populations tended to generate synchrony domains that extended over a large number of populations. When the rates of exchange between local populations were relatively low, then permanent travelling waves emerged, especially after an initial invasion phase. There was a non-linear relationship between the amount of dispersal and the domain of synchrony that this movement generated. Furthermore, the observed spatiotemporal patterns that emerged following an initial invasion phase were found to be highly dependent on the extreme distances reached by rare dispersers. 4. As populations of voles are predominantly distributed in grassland patches created by clear-cutting of forest stands, we estimated the mean patch diameter and mean interpatch distance using a geographical information system (GIS) of the forest. Our simplified models suggest that if as much as 5-10% of each vole population dispersed a mean of 178 m between clear-cuts per generation, then this would generate a synchrony domain and speed of wave in the region of 6-24 km (per year), which is reasonably consistent with the observed synchrony domain and speed. Much less dispersal would be capable of generating this scale of domain if some individuals occasionally moved beyond the nearest-neighbour patch. 5. While we still do not know what causes the local oscillations, our models question the need to invoke additional factors to explain large-scale synchrony and travelling waves beyond small-scale dispersal and local density-dependent feedback. Our work also suggests that the higher degrees of synchrony observed in Fennoscandian habitats compared with Kielder may be due in part to the relative ease of movement of voles in these former habitats. As our work confirms that the rates of exchange among local populations will have a strong influence on synchrony, then we anticipate that the spatiotemporal distribution of clear-cuts will also have an important influence on the dynamics of predators of voles.},

Another distinct component, the Lepidoptera, Hemerobiidae, Chrysopidae and Ichneumonidae, which were all intercorrelated in the results, possibly indicates feeding near trees.

The spatial and temporal predictions of the model were tested against badger demography and TB prevalence data derived from the field. When validated in space, the model generated population sizes and disease incidence that were consistent with the observed field population. We conclude that modelling TB dynamics must include spatial and temporal heterogeneity in life history parameters, social behaviour and the landscape.

When validated in space, the model generated population sizes and disease incidence that were consistent with the observed field population. We conclude that modelling TB dynamics must include spatial and temporal heterogeneity in life history parameters, social behaviour and the landscape. Based on parameter sensitivity and data availability, we suggest priorities for future empirical research on badgers and bovine tuberculosis. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In Britain, the use of "second-generation'' rodenticides has become widespread on agricultural premises. The high toxicity and relatively long half-lives of these compounds has raised concerns over potential secondary exposure and poisoning of non-target predators. Over the last 15 years, exposure has been extensively documented in the barn owl Tyto alba but relatively little is known about mammalian terrestrial predators. This paper reviews recent studies and demonstrates that there is evidence of both secondary exposure and secondary poisoning in a variety of non-target, terrestrial mammals in Britain. It also presents new data on rodenticide levels in the polecat Mustela putorius which preys on farmyard rats in winter in Britain and ist therefore, considered to be highly vulnerable to exposure to rodenticides. The new data demonstrated that 26% of polecats in the sample contained difenacoum or bromadiolone and that exposure was geographically widespread and occurred in several years. The possible effects of secondary exposure on populations of polecats and other predators are discussed.},

abstract = {In Britain, polecats Mustela putorius hunt around farm buildings, especially in winter, and, as a result, may be secondarily exposed to rodenticides by eating contaminated prey. This paper reports the first survey of second-generation rodenticides in polecats. Twenty-nine adult polecats which had been killed either accidentally on roads (24) and in traps (4), or had died of an unknown cause (1) were collected during 1992-1994. The livers of 24 animals and the stomach walls of the remaining five, for which the livers were not available, were analysed for difenacoum, bromadiolone, brodifacoum and flocoumafen. In total, rodenticide residues were detected in 31% of the polecats analysed. Residues were found in seven of the 24 livers (29%) and in two of the Jive stomachs analysed (40%). Difenacoum was detected most frequently (28% of animals), and was the only rodenticide in the stomach, while bromadiolone and brodifacoum were detected in only 10% and 3% of polecats, respectively. Flocoumafen was not detected in any animals. More than one rodenticide occurred in the livers of two animals; one contained difenacoum and bromadiolone, the other also contained brodifacoum. There was no sex bias in the proportion of animals containing rodenticides. Animals with detectable residues came from more than one county and were collected only during January-April in each year.},

abstract = {Little is known about the ecotoxicological hazard of cadmium to wild small mammals. This paper reviewed laboratory and field studies to determine: (i) intake and residue lowest-observable-adverse-effect-level (LOAELs) for the ecologically important parameters of reproduction and development; (ii) whether these LOAELs are exceeded by wild small mammals on contaminated habitats and what adverse effects result; and (iii) which species may be at most risk from cadmium. The intake LOAEL in laboratory rodents was 3.5-7.5 mg kg(-1) body wt day(-1) and the residue LOAEL, based on cellular damage in the kidney, was a renal cadmium concentration of 105 mg kg(-1) dry wt. On contaminated habitats, these LOAELs are exceeded by common shrews Sorex araneus but not by wild rodents. However, there is little evidence of adverse cadmium-mediated effects in common shrews and this species may be tolerant to cadmium exposure. Large cadmium concentrations in body organs may simply reflect an ability to store cadmium in a nontoxic, metallothionein-bound state. In contrast, studies suggest that microtine voles may be sensitive to cadmium and, despite their relatively low cadmium intake and accumulated residues, may suffer adverse effects. The need to establish dose-residue-effect relationships for intakes and residues which are appropriate for wild species and also based on ecologically important parameters is discussed.

pages = {211-217},
abstract = {Methiocarb is a carbamate molluscicide widely used in pelleted form. Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus are commonly found in arable fields and will eat methiocarb pellets. Two previous field studies on the impacts on arable wood mice of broadcasting methiocarb pellets produced contrasting results, the number of mice being temporarily reduced in one but not the other. The season of application is also likely to influence the degree of impact on populations but the previous trials were both in autumn, The aim of the present study was to determine the effects on wood mice of broadcast applications of methiocarb in both autumn and spring and to determine whether depression of brain and serum cholinesterase (ChE) activity, a biomarker of exposure, could be detected in mice alive on treated fields after application. In trials carried out in October 1994 and April 1995, there were decreases in the number of wood mice on arable fields following pesticide application. The October decline (78%) was greater than that in April (33%), even though the activity of the mice appeared to be more heavily centred on the hedgerows, where pellets were not applied, in the autumn. Despite the reductions in numbers, no depression of ChE activity was detected in mice captured alive after application, suggesting that either exposed animals were not captured or that reactivation of ChE activity was rapid. This study confirmed that broadcast application of methiocarb can reduce wood mouse populations on arable fields. It also demonstrated that such effects can occur irrespective of season and that measurement of ChE activity in mice trapped after application may fail to indicate that exposure of the population has occurred.

Trapping studies on larger sites indicated that liming also reduced pygmy shrew abundance; the numbers captured on limed sites were 30-55% lower than on control areas. The persistence of the effects of liming on pygmy shrews varied from between five months to over three years at different sites. Liming had a less marked effect on common shrews S. araneus, reducing surface activity for two to three months but having no effect on numbers and demography. Liming did not affect the nutritional state of either shrew species.},

number = {1},
pages = {130-137},
abstract = {Calcium intake by wild rodents varies with season and habitat. This may have important ecological consequences; several studies have suggested that calcium availability may limit growth and reproduction. We studied the effect on growth of varying the calcium intake of captive wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus (L.) and bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus (Schreber 1780). To determine whether effects observed in the laboratory could be detected in free-living animals, we also compared the body weights and lengths of free-living animals on calcium-poor gritstone areas with those of rodents on calcium-rich limestone habitats where the dietary calcium concentration was between 2 and 5 times higher. Captive wood mice fed high calcium (0.87%) diet grew at the same rate as mice fed low calcium (0.30%) diet but continued growing for longer, thereby achieving higher asymptotic weights. In contrast, captive bank voles fed the high calcium diet grew more slowly and had lower asymptotic weights than voles fed the low calcium diet. As expected from the laboratory growth study, the higher calcium intake of free-living wood mice on the limestone was associated with greater body size compared with mice on the gritstone. However, bank voles were also larger on the limestone, even though high calcium intake impaired growth in captive animals. The contrast between wood mice and bank voles in the effects of calcium on growth, the reason why impaired growth may not be apparent in bank voles from calcium-rich habitats and the ecological significance of these results are discussed.},

Red squirrels were also found to have died from a range of pathological infections and disease previously unrecorded in Wales. These data have increased our knowledge on the national distribution of such causal factors. The study found male red squirrels were less likely to have an adenovirus infection than females and that animals dying from disease had a lower body mass than those associated with a traumatic death. No red squirrels were found with squirrelpox infection or antibodies to this virus which reinforces earlier findings from Anglesey that intensive grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) culling reduced the prevalence of this infection within sympatric populations.

Boxes were used by adults, subadults, lactating females and their young. Breeding females more frequently used the larger of the two box designs, although this preference was not statistically significant. There was no difference in the mean sizes of litters found within the two box types. The mean size of litters present in boxes was 2.7 (n = 31, SE = 0.23) which was similar to the mean litter size of 2.5 (n = 8, SE = 0.50) found in dreys. Thus, nest boxes proved to be a valuable research tool for monitoring parturition dates, litter sizes, nestling sex ratios, and preweaning mortality.},

abstract = {The effect of ad libitum supplemental feeding upon the diet and foraging behaviour of red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris was studied in a coniferous habitat during May 1994 - July 1996. Although supplemental feeding in the form of peanuts was widely available, the animals continued to exploit natural foods such as pine seed, buds and flowers. The degree to which pine seed was exploited was a function of pine cone availability. In contrast, peanut consumption was not correlated with peanut availability, but was determined by the abundance of pine cones. During late winter and spring when seed was becoming scarce, peanuts contributed 30-56% of the dietary items. In addition, increasing amounts of alternative 'low energy' foods such as buds and flowers were also exploited. These foods are calcium rich and their ingestion would compensate for the high phosphorus content of peanuts. The nutritional composition of peanuts appears to have restricted the degree to which they could be included in the diet. Nevertheless peanuts were an important dietary component, and seasonally contributed 25-181% of the animals' basic daily energy requirements. Supplemental feeding was associated with relatively large amounts of activity occurring on the ground (annual mean estimates were 47 and 50% of total foraging time). The animals continued to exhibit 'scatter-hoarding' behaviour, with peanuts accounting for 90% of the identified cached items. This stored resource could satisfy 344 (1994/95) and 198 (1995/96) days of the animals' basic energy requirements.},

Initially 30 nest boxes were erected with eight additional boxes being put up in 1995. In the period 1994 to 1997, red squirrels were found to use nest boxes regularly as nesting and breeding sites (7.8 +/- 1.0 SE litters found annually). Box use was greatest in the summer and autumn months (70% of boxes being used at least once) and declined through the winter (50%) into the spring (45%). The presence of great tit clutches and broods in the spring did not prevent red squirrels from occupying boxes. Only 28% (n = 12) of all the recorded great tit clutches produced fledgling young in 1994 to 1997 and red squirrels were found to have consumed some of the chicks and eggs. The establishment of a Jackdaw colony within the woodland led to 86% of the nest boxes being used by the birds in the spring of 1999. Red squirrel occupation of boxes in the spring declined to 7% and only three litters were recorded that year. The study showed that the jackdaw has the capacity to dominate nest boxes during the spring months despite the high density of red squirrels within the reserve.},

We used Global Positioning System tracking collars to monitor the movements of red deer (Cervus elaphus) stags (n = 8) in a herd whose feeding grounds lie close to a popular walking track in the Highlands of Scotland. The track is used by around 20,000 walkers per year and is busiest in summer and at weekends. In a 2-year study, the locations of collared deer were recorded at 2-h intervals on typically busy days (Sundays: mean number of walkers = 204) and quiet days (Wednesdays: mean number of walkers = 49) during May and June. The deer were consistently further from the track on Sundays than Wednesdays (371 vs 286 m) and moved greater distances between fixes (365 vs 308 m). The amount of time spent (percentage of total fixes) in the small area of grassland closest to the track was lower on Sundays than Wednesdays (6% vs 13%). Although 97% of walkers use the track during the day (between 0800 and 2000 h), there was no evidence of compensatory use of grassland at night, when the deer moved to higher ground dominated by heather moorland. The results demonstrate that animals which appear to be habituated to regular disturbance within their home territory may nevertheless alter their behaviour and potentially diet composition, as a result of that disturbance.},

abstract = {In two experiments, in the growing season March-May, freshly harvested double-low oilseed rape (Brassica napus) plants were fed ad libitum to penned roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus). In Experiment 1, oilseed rape was fed to five roe and 12 red deer as 60% of their daily dry matter (DM) intake for four weeks, after a two-week dietary change-over period. The rest of the diet comprised cattle-rearing pellets (33%) and freshly cut heather (Calluna vulgaris) plants (7%)(.) In Experiment 2, oilseed rape was fed to seven roe and eight red deer as 100% of the diet for up to six weeks, after a two-week change-over period. In both experiments, Heinz bodies were found in roe deer blood 2-3 weeks after the start of the change-over period, with a fall in mean packed cell volume (PCV) and blood glutathione (GSH) concentration. In Experiment 2, after 5-8 days of feeding on 100% oilseed rape, four roe deer showed signs of inappetance and were changed to a diet of 80% oilseed rape. At the same time, the other three roe deer had very low PCV (< 60% of normal values) and oilseed rape feeding was discontinued for those animals. The red deer showed no symptoms of haemolytic damage nor any change in blood GSH concentration in either experiment, but showed a gradual fall in PCV in Experiment 2. No other ill-effects were observed in any of the animals. Intakes of oilseed rape (gDM/kg(0.75)/day) were lower for the roe deer than the red deer in both experiments. The severity of haemolytic anaemia in the roe deer was related to the proportion of oilseed rape in the diet, rather than the amount ingested. It was concluded that the health of roe deer ingesting oilseed rape may be affected if other foods are not available.},

LocationEleven study areas (averaging similar to 21.3km(2)) spread over similar to 50,000km(2) in Northern Scotland. MethodsWhile accounting for heterogeneous detectability, we applied single-season occupancy models to broad-scale camera-trapping data (168 stations) to evaluate how Autumn-Winter weather conditions interact with land-cover type (including agricultural land) and human disturbance to determine badger occupancy. ResultsMean minimum daily winter temperature and elevation influenced inter-site occupancy. When clustering study areas into two distinct topo-climatic types, badger occupancy was associated with agriculture in areas with lower mean minimum winter temperatures (<0.3 degrees C) at higher elevation (>246m). In areas with higher mean minimum winter temperature (>1.2 degrees C) at lower elevation (<133m), badgers selected sites further away from human infrastructures (settlements and main roads). Climatic factors and human disturbance interact in intricate, context-dependent patterns to determine badger site occupancy. Main ConclusionsThe UKCP09 Medium Emissions Scenario projects a winter mean minimum temperature increase of between 1 and 3 degrees C (central estimate) for Northern Scotland by the 2050s. Although warmer weather should benefit badger occupancy, this may be counteracted by up to a predicted 5% human population increase in the Scottish highlands, by 2037, which is likely to disturb badgers. We show that even in instances where species' regional responses to climate change are positive, these effects can be neutralized by other anthropogenic pressures. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence advocating that interactive effects should be taken into account when planning conservation management.},

abstract = {Aim European wildcat Felis silvestris silvestris (Schreber, 1775) populations are suffering considerable threats, making conservation action a priority. In Scotland, the establishment of Special Areas of Wildcat Conservation (SAWC) have been recommended; however, few studies have addressed wildcat ecological requirements in this region. Our goal was to identify the environmental determinants limiting wildcat occurrence at a broad scale in Scotland. Location Scotland, Europe. Methods We examined data from the recent Scottish wildcat survey (20062008) and the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) Gateway. Presence and pseudo-absence data from 71 sampling units (10 km x 10 km) were used to generate models explaining probable wildcat occurrence. Models were built based on three pre-established hypotheses using generalized linear models (GLM-Logit). Results European rabbit presence, high rodent diversity and the prevalence of large grassland areas were positively associated with probable wildcat occurrence. Heather moorland, sampling units with few grassland patches or secondary watercourses and higher elevation ranges were associated with probable wildcat absence. We found no evidence that forested areas or human disturbance were influential. Main conclusions Our results suggest that wildcats may benefit from heterogeneity within the landscape matrix, reinforcing the idea that the wildcat is not primarily a forest species (as has traditionally been inferred from studies of the species elsewhere). We conclude that less mountainous areas, with a diverse landscape including woodland and grassland supporting rabbits and a diversity of small rodents are a priority for wildcat conservation efforts.},

abstract = {Free-ranging ecological resources are frequently managed with an age- and gender-structured complexity beyond that handled routinely in optimising bioeconomic analysis. Here we use a Hamiltonian-based solution method to develop optimal management prescriptions for a bioeconomic system comprising 14 state variables and 6 control variables: red deer management in the Scottish Highlands. We consider management on estates where deer are husbanded as a sporting resource, and on sites where deer density is reduced to promote the regeneration of native woodland. We focus in particular on the consequences of deer emigration/immigration, between neighbouring sites pursuing conflicting management objectives. Our results suggest that a strong stock effect on culling cost and a wide disparity in value between culled males and females underlie the high population densities and female-biased herd structures which prevail across the Highlands. Neither of these effects have been included in earlier ecological models of red deer management. Results also suggest that managing deer density to secure the regeneration of native woodland will incur considerable costs. We also show that emigration/ immigration of immature male deer between a neighbouring sporting estate and woodland regeneration site carries adverse cost implications for both parties. Whilst deer management on sporting estates may respond to financial incentives, the strong inverse relationship between deer density and culling cost will prevent such mechanisms from delivering substantial reductions in deer density under current property rights.

abstract = {A simple deterministic simulation model was constructed to examine compensatory mechanisms of a seasonal breeder following population reduction, with a view to determining the optimum time of year to apply such control. Data collected from studies on the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, were used in the model. The compensatory mechanisms considered were a reduction in mortality, an increase in fecundity, an increase in the length of the breeding season, and a combination of reduced mortality and increased fecundity. Any degree of seasonality in either mortality or breeding led to an optimum time of year to apply a control policy, if some level of compensation occurred. In the absence of such compensation, there was no optimal time to perform population control. If such control is unbiased toward either sex then the optimum time of control is usually at the beginning of the breeding season (January). The optimum time for a male biased control policy was during the non-breeding season (November to January). Female biased control led to a more complex situation where the optimum was dependent upon the type of compensation and the degree of such compensation. This work has shown that the presence and form of compensatory mechanisms (density-dependence) may produce or adjust the optimum timing of control in populations which have either seasonal variation in mortality or fecundity.

abstract = {The occurrence of a wildlife rabies epizootic in Britain remains a very unlikely event, but it is important to examine all the possible consequences of such an event. Here, I examine the possible role of the European Badger (Alleles meles) in such an epizootic. The population density of Badgers in Britain is much higher than that in Europe, and appears to have increased substantially over the last decade or so. The population parameters and epizootiology of rabies in the Badger are reviewed in comparison with the Fox (Vulpes vulpes) and other species. Mustelids appear to be very susceptible to rabies, with the smaller mustelids becoming aggressive, although Badgers do not appear to show heightened aggression when infected. Badger populations on the continent become severely reduced when rabies arrives in the area, and circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that Badgers can easily transmit the virus. Preliminary models support the idea that the Badger could be a very significant secondary host, especially in the initial rabies outbreak. The population recovery rate of the Badger suggests that it is unlikely to become a primary host, although short-term epizootics in the Badger population are likely. The potential for controlling rabies in the Badger is also examined.},

abstract = {1. A simulation model was used to evaluate the effect of different levels of culling on six badger social groups in an attempt to reduce or eradicate TB infection from the population. Apart from fecundity, all model parameters were derived from a comprehensive study of a naturally-infected badger population in England. 2. Badger control was simulated using a trap-and-cull of 80% of all badgers in either two social groups (localized strategy) or all six social groups (wide area strategy). Lactating females were permitted to infect none or all of their young, to simulate the extremes of sow-to-cub (pseudo-vertical) transmission. Trapped lactating sows were either all released or all killed. 3. Simulations where all infected badgers can be correctly diagnosed were also run to determine the importance of an improved live test for TB. 4. In the absence of badger control, pseudo-vertical transmission increased the persistence and prevalence of TB in the simulated population. 5. A single control operation was capable of eradicating TB from the population only if all six badger social groups were subjected to culling. If only infected individuals were killed, disease eradication was possible without a marked increase in population extinction. If all individuals were killed, the increased level of disease eradication occurred as a result of an increase in population extinction. 6. Killing lactating sows had no effect on the medium-term prevalence (up to 20 years) of the disease and resulted only in a reduced persistence of TB when a wide area badger control strategy was used.},

abstract = {1. An individual-based stochastic simulation model was used to investigate the control of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in the European badger Meles meles by using a live test to determine the presence of infection. The model was an extension of earlier models, and nearly all population and epidemiological parameters were derived from one study site. 2. This is the first TB model to examine sex differences in disease epidemiology, and the transmission of TB from badgers to cattle. The latter is an essential step if reactive badger control strategies are to be modelled. 3. Heterogeneity was introduced to the simulation model by the use of a carrying capacity, which defined the maximum number of breeding females per social group. 4. The prevalence of TB, and the number of simulated cattle herd breakdowns, was reduced for all control strategies using a live test, namely localised culling, ring culling and proactive culling. However, only proactive culling resulted in a marked reduction in these values within a few years. 5. If trapping efficacy was increased above its current value (80%), this did not improve the effectiveness of these culling strategies. 6. If the number of individual badgers caught and tested per social group was doubled from two to four animals per group, then the overall level of effectiveness of these strategies could be doubled. 7. The effectiveness could be improved if the sensitivity of the live test was increased, but did not continue to show an improvement above a sensitivity of about 70%. 8. Given the constraints of the current live test sensitivity (41%) and a trapping efficacy of 80%, proactive culling, following the testing of four individuals per group, led to an average of three cattle herd breakdowns per year in the simulation, compared with an average of 31 per year when simulating the live test trial as used between 1994 and 1996.},

abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (TB) appears to be endemic within the badger population of south-west England. The total number of cattle herds with confirmed tuberculosis has increased from 197 in 1992 to 320 in 1993, and the badger is believed to be responsible for many of these breakdowns. Data on a high density badger population naturally infected with tuberculosis have been collected since the late 1970s. This paper presents some of the results of this epidemiological. study and shows how localised the disease has been over a number of years. We also describe a number of models that have been used to help understand the progression of the disease within the population. These are simple, within-group infection models used primarily to help to understand the disease dynamics. The option to add vaccination, or restructure the model for other species, such as possums is always available. The results suggest that TB would only be sustained for long periods in social groups with about eight or more members, and that disease spread does not correspond to classical epidemiological models.},

Here we mathematically examine the implications of variation in reproductive season length caused by delayed densitydependent changes in its start date. We demonstrate that when reproductive season length is a function of past population densities, it is possible to get realistic population cycles without invoking any changes in birth rates or survival. When parameterized for field voles (Microtus agrestis) in Kielder Forest (northern England), our most realistic model predicts population cycles of similar periodicity to the Kielder populations. Our study highlights the potential importance of density-dependent reproductive timing in microtine population cycles and calls for investigations into the mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon.},

abstract = {1. Recent studies of rodent populations have demonstrated that certain parasites can cause juveniles to delay maturation until the next reproductive season. Furthermore, a variety of parasites may share the same host, and evidence is beginning to accumulate showing nonindependent effects of different infections. 2. We investigated the consequences for host population dynamics of a disease-induced period of no reproduction, and a chronic reduction in fecundity following recovery from infection (such as may be induced by secondary infections) using a modified SIR (susceptible, infected, recovered) model. We also included a seasonally varying birth rate as recent studies have demonstrated that seasonally varying parameters can have important effects on long-term host-parasite dynamics. We investigated the model predictions using parameters derived from five different cyclic rodent populations. 3. Delayed and reduced fecundity following recovery from infection have no effect on the ability of the disease to regulate the host population in the model as they have no effect on the basic reproductive rate. However, these factors can influence the long-term dynamics including whether or not they exhibit multiyear cycles. 4. The model predicts disease-induced multiyear cycles for a wide range of realistic parameter values. Host populations that recover relatively slowly following a disease-induced population crash are more likely to show multiyear cycles. Diseases for which the period of infection is brief, but full recovery of reproductive function is relatively slow, could generate large amplitude multiyear cycles of several years in length. Chronically reduced fecundity following recovery can also induce multiyear cycles, in support of previous theoretical studies. 5. When parameterized for cowpox virus in the cyclic field vole populations (Microtus agrestis) of Kielder Forest (northern England), the model predicts that the disease must chronically reduce host fecundity by more than 70%, following recovery from infection, for it to induce multiyear cycles. When the model predicts quasi-periodic multiyear cycles it also predicts that seroprevalence and the effective date of onset of the reproductive season are delayed density-dependent, two phenomena that have been recorded in the field.},

abstract = {Natterer's bat Myotis nattereri is one of the least known European bats, using roosts inaccessible to humans and shifting to alternative roosts every few days. The characteristics of day and night roosts used by maternity colonies during summer was assessed. Roosts were located by radio-tracking. Roost sites (which may contain more than one roost) were concentrated mainly in core areas of up to 2 km(2), within which roost site density ranged from 7 to 15 per km2. Day roosts included tree cavities, apices of attics, mortises in attics and in barns, soffit boxes at eaves, tops of gable walls, crevices in stone walls and a modern cavity wall. Trees comprised 67% of roost sites. Two maternity colonies each used between 21 and 31 roosts distributed across 15 to 25 roost sites. During late summer, the temperature of roosts adjacent to a roof covering averaged 22.5 degrees C during the day and were significantly warmer than roosts in trees, which averaged 17.3 degrees C. Attic mortise roosts were intermediate at 20.0 degrees C. The maximum ambient roost temperature in which bats remained was 32 degrees C and the maximum body surface temperature recorded while roosting was 37.6 degrees C. Thus, bats seem to require access to a large number of roosts with a range of temperatures that they can use depending on their reproductive state and energy requirements. The study colonies also exhibited high inter-annual fidelity to roosts. Attic maternity roosts used during late gestation and early lactation were reused for the same function in successive years, as were heavily timbered barns during late lactation and post-lactation. This continuing dependence upon established roosts indicates that these types of maternity roost should be given high conservation priority. Field boundaries should also be managed to maintain mature trees with cavities for potential day roosts and hedges suitable as night perches.},

abstract = {1. Studies of habitat use in which the individual animal is the sampling unit should ideally sample each individual sufficiently to achieve a stable estimate of its habitat use. Data are typically obtained by radio-tracking, which can be labour-intensive. Hence, optimization of sampling effort is desirable. A method to determine optimum sampling effort is described with reference to an example from a study of Natterer's bat Myotis nattereri, in which data were collected by radio-tracking with individual bats followed continuously for entire nights. 2. Habitat use by Natterer's bat was assessed by compositional analysis, which compares the composition of habitats used with those potentially available. Therefore, we plotted running per cent foraging time spent over a range of habitat types against the cumulative foraging time recorded. We visually estimated the optimum sum of foraging time required to determine stable estimates of the composition of habitat use from the plots. Then, by reference to the full-time budget, the total tracking effort expended at the point when this optimum amount of foraging data had been recorded was determined and expressed in units of the number of nightly tracking sessions that had been undertaken to collect that amount of foraging data. 3. Stable estimates of habitat use were attained after a mean of 22 +/- 7.7 h of foraging time, which were obtained in a mean of 4.6 +/- 1.9 nights of radio-tracking effort. Thus, in this Natterer's bat study, where habitat preference was assessed by compositional analysis, it was appropriate to aim to collect foraging data during five nights of radio-tracking for each bat sampled. 4. The method presented is also applicable to studies where tracking data are discontinuous. A variation of the method can be applied in studies where a Euclidean distance method is to be used for the analysis of habitat use.},

Habitat selection was random at neither level. When selecting foraging ranges, bats maximized the area of semi-natural broad-leaved woodland and improved grassland and minimized that of dense coniferous plantations. During foraging, semi-natural broad-leaved woodland and river corridors were preferred, while dense coniferous plantations were avoided. Within individual foraging ranges, the intensity of foraging activity over river corridor habitat and semi-natural broad-leaved woodland was 8.2 and 3.8 times higher, respectively, than that over improved grassland. For successful management of Natterer's bat populations, semi-natural broad-leaved woodland should be retained. Clear felling of large blocks of native broad-leaved woodland should be avoided and conifers should not be used for reforestation. Tree cover along river banks should be encouraged and protected.},

abstract = {Natterer's bat Myotis nattereri is one of the least known European bats. Understanding its patterns of movement between roosts is an important aspect of assessing the relative value of different types of roost for conservation of the species. We determined patterns of movement of Natterer's bat between roosts by radio-tracking successive animals from the same colonies during summer (May to September). For one maternity colony comprising 65 adult females, the attic of a large mediaeval church was the main roost site, accounting for 88% of radio-located bat days. The two other maternity colonies tracked comprised about 35 adult females each and used from 15 to 25 roost sites, some containing multiple roosts. For these two colonies, up to six roost sites per colony accounted for about 80% of bat occupancy days in any one summer and for each colony, roost home ranges for roosts used by subgroups of at least two bats together covered 0.4 km(2). Although bats made frequent movements between roosts there was no apparent interchange between adjacent colonies and no overlap in the range used by adjacent colonies. Bats changed roosts every 3.0 days on average, moving 510 m (median) to an alternative roost. They departed late and returned early to roosts. Colonies assembled or disintegrated into larger or smaller groups occupying diverse roosts during summer, but there was high social cohesion between colony members. Bats that separated into subgroups from mid-summer (mid-July) onwards later roosted together again. Natterer's bat exhibits high behavioural flexibility in the type of roosts used: of two adjacent maternity colonies, one used mostly tree roosts and the other mostly buildings. However, both roosted mainly in roofs during early summer (late May to mid-July). Tree roosts were significantly preferred to those in buildings when ambient external maximum temperatures were >= 30 degrees C or mean temperatures fell below 14 degrees C. Natterer's bat appears to depend on the availability of a number of roosts of different types. Parturition roosts, roosts in heavily timbered barns and roosts within core roosting areas, potentially up to 1.2 km distant from the parturition roost, should have highest conservation priority but conservation management should guard against any roost loss.},

abstract = {1. European hares Lepus europaeus have declined throughout Europe since the 1960s. Possible reasons for this include agricultural intensification and changes in climate and predator numbers, but no clear consensus has been reached as to the relative importance of each of these. We aimed to identify factors associated with high and low hare numbers throughout Europe, to determine which could have caused population declines. 2. Results of 77 research papers from 12 European countries were summarized. Relationships between hare density and demographics and habitat, climate, hunting and predator variables were examined and quantified where possible. Temporal changes in factors identified as being associated with high or low numbers of hares were then examined to see if they could explain population declines. 3. Data from pastural habitats were limited, but densities of hares were low. Arable habitats had higher densities than mixed areas in spring, unless farming was intensive in which case densities were similar. In autumn the two habitats had similar densities. Field size, temperature, precipitation and hunting had no effect on density throughout Europe. Fecundity was affected by climate. 4. Arable land, various crops, fallow habitat and temperature were positively associated, and monoculture, precipitation and predators negatively associated with hare abundance. The relationship of field size, pasture and woodland with abundance depended on spatial scale. 5. Habitat changes caused by agricultural intensification are the ultimate cause of hare population declines. Effects of changes in climate or predator numbers are magnified by the loss of high-quality year-round forage and cover. Further research is required on how habitat changes affect fecundity and survival, and to identify which parameters have the greatest impact on population numbers. Farmland management policies that target the re-establishment of some of the habitat diversity lost within fields, farms and landscapes will help to reverse the decline of the European hare.},

journal = {Journal of Applied Ecology},

abstract = {1. Agricultural intensification has had dramatic effects on farmland biodiversity and has caused declines in many taxa. Habitat changes are thought to be the main cause of the decline in numbers of European hares, Lepus europaeus, throughout Europe. In Britain there is greater potential to increase hare numbers in pastural landscapes than in arable landscape. Hares in pasture have lower population densities, poorer body condition and participate less in breeding than in arable habitats. We aimed to investigate habitat selection and home range size in a mainly pastural area in order to reveal why the habitat is suboptimal, and how it could be managed to benefit the species. 2. A seasonal radio-tracking study was used to determine the importance of heterogeneity at the between- and within-habitat scales. Habitat selection by active and resting hares was quantified. Selection was investigated by categorizing habitats by type, and by structure in terms of vegetation height. 3. Mean home range size was 34 ha. Winter and spring ranges were larger than summer and autumn ranges. Hares selected fallow land and pasture grazed by cattle in preference to arable crops throughout the year, except during the winter when crops were suitable as forage. Pasture grazed by sheep was avoided in all seasons but winter. Heterogeneity at the between-habitat scale was less important to hares than heterogeneity at the within-habitat scale in the pastural landscape studied. 4. Hares selected habitats with taller vegetation during the spring and summer. Many of the habitats selected were heterogeneous in structure mainly due to cattle grazing, and hares avoided short homogeneous vegetation in all seasons. Hares are more likely to be limited by habitat in terms of cover than food in these landscapes. 5. Synthesis and applications. Increasing habitat heterogeneity at the farm scale may benefit hares, especially in highly homogeneous, intensively managed landscapes. However, managers of pastural farmland should aim to increase habitat heterogeneity at the within-habitat (or within-field) scale in particular, to provide better cover throughout the year. Agri-environment schemes should target the regeneration of heterogeneity in pastural landscapes, by encouraging changes such as an increase in fallow land and a reduction in livestock density. Such shifts in management are likely to benefit both hares and farmland biodiversity in general.},

abstract = {European hares Lepus europaeus Pallas, 1778 have lower population densities and body condition in pastural landscapes than in arable landscapes, but reasons for this are not understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether forage quality is low in pastural landscapes during certain seasons. We carried out chemical analysis of the nutritional quality of 5 habitat types to determine whether hares select high quality habitats, and whether nutritional quality explains seasonal differences in range sizes of hares in pastural landscapes. Hares did not tend to select habitats of high nutritional quality (protein, fat or energy) over those of lower quality. Hares did not increase active range size as the overall energy content of forage at the study site decreased; seasonal differences in active range size were not explained by nutritional quality. Differences may be explained by behavioural changes related to breeding. Pastural habitat is fairly stable in terms of nutritional quality through the year, and results suggest that poor forage quality is unlikely to be responsible for the poor body condition of hares in pastural landscapes. Hares in these landscapes are more likely to be limited by habitat quality in terms of cover than by forage.},

There are clear differences in frequency and duration of visits to latrines between members of the different age, sex, and social-status classes; behavior while on latrines; and the behavioral context of latrine visits. Pellets deposited while on a latrine elicited further defecation more often than pellets deposited at random.

The red fox, Vulpes vulpes, exhibits a highly flexible social system and one that is thought to represent a possible stage in the evolution of more complex patterns of group-living. Although the potential benefits accruing to philopatric offspring have previously been studied in this species, the potential costs of dispersal have received less attention. We contrasted survival rates, nutritional status, injuries and reproductive output of dispersing and non-dispersing male and female foxes in an urban population to assess the relative costs of dispersal versus natal philopatry. Mortality rates were not significantly higher for dispersing foxes, either in the short- or long-term. There was no evidence of increased nutritional stress in dispersing individuals. Dispersing individuals did, however, exhibit greater levels of wounding, although this did not appear to affect survival. Dispersing females were more likely to miss a breeding opportunity early in their reproductive lifespan. In contrast, both dispersing and non-dispersing males were unlikely to breed in their first year. We conclude that the major fitness component in females affected by dispersing is age at first reproduction.},

abstract = {1Disease epizootics can significantly influence host population dynamics and the structure and functioning of ecological communities. Sarcoptic mange Sarcoptes scabiei has dramatically reduced red fox populations Vulpes vulpes in several countries, including Britain, although impacts on demographic processes are poorly understood. We review the literature on the impact of mange on red fox populations, assess its current distribution in Britain through a questionnaire survey and present new data on resultant demographic changes in foxes in Bristol, UK. 2A mange epizootic in Sweden spread across the entire country in < 10 years resulting in a decline in fox density of up to 95%; density remained lowered for 15-20 years. In Spain, mange has been enzootic for > 75 years and is widely distributed; mange presence was negatively correlated with habitat quality. 3Localized outbreaks have occurred sporadically in Britain during the last 100 years. The most recent large-scale outbreak arose in the 1990s, although mange has been present in south London and surrounding environs since the 1940s. The questionnaire survey indicated that mange was broadly distributed across Britain, but areas of perceived high prevalence (> 50% affected) were mainly in central and southern England. Habitat type did not significantly affect the presence/absence of mange or perceived prevalence rates. Subjective assessments suggested that populations take 15-20 years to recover. 4Mange appeared in Bristol's foxes in 1994. During the epizootic phase (1994-95), mange spread through the city at a rate of 0.6-0.9 km/month, with a rise in infection in domestic dogs Canis familiaris c. 1-2 months later. Juvenile and adult fox mortality increased and the proportion of females that reproduced declined but litter size was unaffected. Population density declined by > 95%. 5In the enzootic phase (1996-present), mange was the most significant mortality factor. Juvenile mortality was significantly higher than in the pre-mange period, and the number of juveniles classified as dispersers declined. Mange infection reduced the reproductive potential of males and females: females with advanced mange did not breed; severely infected males failed to undergo spermatogenesis. In 2004, Bristol fox population density was only 15% of that in 1994.},

abstract = {Movements away from the natal or home territory are important to many ecological processes, including gene flow, population regulation, and disease epidemiology, yet quantitative data on these behaviors are lacking. Red foxes exhibit 2 periods of extraterritorial movements: when an individual disperses and when males search neighboring territories for extrapair copulations during the breeding season. Using radiotracking data collected at 5-min interfix intervals, we compared movement parameters, including distance moved, speed of movement, and turning angles, of dispersal and reproductive movements to those made during normal territorial movements; the instantaneous separation distances of dispersing and extraterritorial movements to the movements of resident adults; and the frequency of locations of 95%, 60%, and 30% harmonic mean isopleths of adult fox home territories to randomly generated fox movements. Foxes making reproductive movements traveled farther than when undertaking other types of movement, and dispersal movements were straighter. Reproductive and dispersal movements were faster than territorial movements and also differed in intensity of search and thoroughness. Foxes making dispersal movements avoided direct contact with territorial adults and moved through peripheral areas of territories. The converse was true for reproductive movements. Although similar in some basic characteristics, dispersal and reproductive movements are fundamentally different both behaviorally and spatially and are likely to have different ultimate purposes and contrasting effects on spatial processes such as disease transmission.},

abstract = {A model was developed in which patterns of home range area and overlap are an emergent property of individual forager movements over short time scales. Forager movements were simulated as responding to energy requirements, a memory map of food availability and the distribution of nests. Interaction between foragers occurred predominantly as a result of food depletion and the occupation of nests; territorial or mutual avoidance interactions were not included. The model was parameterised for the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) and used to investigate the effect of changing food density on the spacing pattern of a fixed number of individuals (10) within a fixed area (25 ha) of initially uniform food availability. Forager positions were sampled and used to generate estimates of home range area and overlap. The space use patterns generated varied from small, similarly sized, non overlapping ranges at high food densities to large, different sized, overlapping ranges at low food densities. This was a combined result of the change in food density itself, the resultant change in the ratio of population density to carrying capacity and the random positioning of nests. An uncertainty analysis indicated that the results were robust to changing parameter values. The predictions emerged from just one set of relatively simple movement rules. This approach offers the ability to simulate other plausible movement rules (based on food availability and conspecific interactions) to generate further quantitative, testable, predictions regarding the mechanisms causing mammal spacing patterns.

A habitat analysis was conducted using the Land Cover Map (classified satellite imagery developed by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology) to predict the location of areas suitable for beavers. The model was used to simulate population processes within these areas and dispersal between them following a range of reintroduction scenarios. To represent uncertainty regarding the probable behaviour of beavers in Norfolk, the habitat analysis and model were applied using three sets of parameter values (high, medium and low) derived from the literature. It was predicted that Norfolk could support between 18 and 40 beaver families. Using high or medium parameter values, beaver populations were predicted to expand following reintroduction and spread to new areas. Using low parameter values populations were predicted to decrease, risk extinction and not colonize new areas. This analysis is a preliminary investigation into the likely fate of beavers in Norfolk. Checking the estimates of habitat availability in the field would enable greater confidence to be placed in these predictions.},

journal = {Functional Ecology},
volume = {5},
number = {4},
pages = {518-524},
abstract = {Previous studies suggest insectivorous bats occasionally emerge from their roosts during the day to make good shortfalls of energy intake. Other studies indicate that an inadequate nocturnal food supply may negatively affect bat reproduction. The question arises therefore why do temperate insectivorous bats not fly in daylight more frequently? Four hypotheses have been advanced to explain the infrequency of daylight flying. These are overheating, competition, predation and mobbing by non-competitor species. Analysis of behavioural observations in 420 reports of daylight flying, submitted in a national (UK) daylight-flying bat survey revealed that mobbing by non-competitors was very rare (4/420 reports) and its consequences trivial. Flying with aerial insectivorous birds was more frequent (19/420 reports) but antagonism was again uncommon. Predatory attacks, mostly by avian diurnal predators occurred in 13 cases, and in at least five of these instances the attacks were fatal. Large bats survived attacks significantly more than small bats. This may explain why large species of bats flew more frequently in daylight relative to their populations than small bats. In the laboratory pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus Schreber) and brown long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus L.) avoided flying in the light. This effect occurred independently of body temperature and was not mediated by overheating. Furthermore, in the wild, bats did not avoid flying on days which were particularly hot or sunny, suggesting that in Britain overheating does not inhibit daylight flights. Heavier pipistrelle bats avoided the light more than lighter pipistrelle bats. This may reflect lower manoeuvrability and hence greater susceptibility of heavy bats (within a species) to predation, and may explain the reduced frequency of daylight-flying bats in Britain during late June and early July when they are heavily pregnant.},

abstract = {The role played by predation of birds in the mortality of British bats is assessed. A review of dietary studies and anecdotal accounts revealed eleven species of bird which occasionally feed on bats-Herring Gull Larus argentatus, Black-headed Gull Larus ridibundus, Rook Corvus frugilegus, Carrion Crow Corvus corone, Little Owl Athene noctua, Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus, Kestrel Falco tinnunculus, Hobby Falco subbuteo, Merlin Falco columbarius, Peregrine Falco peregrinus and Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus. A further three species feed more frequently on bats-Barn Owl Tyto alba, Tawny Owl Strix aluco and Long-eared Owl Asio otus. Rates of predation were very low accounting for only 0.0034% of items taken by small hawks and falcons (n items = 29 519) but 0.035% of prey taken by owls (n items = 99 479). By multiplying together the average annual prey capture rates of the predators, assessed from their energetic food requirements and direct observations of prey intake rates, the British populations of the predators and the contribution to the diet made by bats, the annual number of bats which die each year as a result of predation was estimated. The total losses of bats to predation might amount to about 201 400 bats/annum. The most significant predators are Tawny Owl (c. 168 850 bats/annum), Barn Owl (c. 8800 bats/annum), Long-eared Owl (c. 10 200 bats/annum) and Kestrels (c. 8400 bats/annum). This predation by avian predators would account for about 11% of the annual mortality of British bats. An assessment of the biases involved in this calculation suggests it is probably a minimum estimate. Despite the apparent low representation of bats in the diets of predatory birds, the effects of this predation on bat behaviour and population dynamics cannot be ignored.},

pages = {111-130},
abstract = {The earliest known complete bats, from the Eocene (49-53 Mya), were already capable of flapping flight and echolocation. In the absence of direct fossil evidence there have been many speculative scenarios advanced to explain the evolution of these behaviours and their distributions in extant bats. Theories assuming chiropteran monophyly have generally presumed the ancestral pre-bat was nocturnal, arboreal and insectivorous. Following this assumption hypotheses can be divided into the echolocation first, flight first and tandem development hypotheses, all of which assume that flight evolved only once in the lineage. In contrast, the chiropteran diphyly hypothesis suggests that flight evolved twice. Evidence supporting and refuting the different hypotheses are reviewed. It is concluded that there are significant problems attached to all the current models. A novel hypothesis is advanced, which starts from the assumption that bats are monophyletic and the ancestral pre-bat was arboreal, but diurnal and frugivorous. After the evolution of flight it is suggested that these animals were driven into the nocturnal niche by the evolution of raptorial birds, and different groups evolved either specialised nocturnal vision (megachiropterans) or echolocation (microchiropterans). A block on sensory modality transfer has retained this distribution of perceptual capabilities ever since, despite some Megachiroptera evolving rudimentary echolocation, and the dietary convergence of some Microchiroptera with the Megachiroptera.

journal = {Animal Behaviour},

abstract = {We refined established methods for examining the temporal organization of behavioural events and applied them to the study of bats emerging from roost sites. Previous studies have shown that as roosting numbers of bats increase, temporal patterning (clustering) in their emergence behaviour, as measured by chi(2) or G statistics, also increases. Expressing the extent of temporal clustering using chi(2) or G, however, confounds two effects. The statistic may increase because clustering increases. However, an increase will occur, even if the amount of clustering stays constant, if the sample size of observations increases. A positive relation between emergence size and chi(2) or G may not necessarily reflect increased clustering. We developed a method to separate these effects using computer-modelled event streams. Using this method, we examined intra- and inter-roost variation in the temporal patterning of emergences of the pipistrelle bat, Pipistrellus pipistrellus, from four roosts in northeast Scotland. The 'corrected' expression of clustering decreased as roost size increased, which was opposite to the effect found with the uncorrected expression and also opposite that predicted a priori from the bottleneck hypothesis. This novel result suggests bottlenecks may disrupt clustering rather than promote it. This latter interpretation was supported by observations that clustering was significantly reduced in the middle of large emergences. Variation in clustering between roosts was significant, suggesting exit topology may have an important influence on clustering behaviour.

journal = {Journal of Zoology},
volume = {225},
pages = {327-345},
abstract = {The contemporary summer populations of three species of bats, the common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) in an area of 3200 km2, in N.E. Scotland (57-degrees-N) near to the northern borders of their distributions, were assessed by surveying nursery roosts. A total of 184 roosts were discovered between 1973 and 1989, and the species in occupation was identified at 147 of these. Of the roosts with identified occupants, 109 were occupied by pipistrelles. Most pipistrelle roosts were located close to the major rivers. The mean roost size in early summer for pipistrelles was 117 individuals. The larger roosts were predominantly (98.8%) female (n = 165). Captured bats foraging on the rivers were only 67% female (n = 102) which indicated there was also a large population of males which the roost survey did not detect. The minimum density of females in the occupied habitat was estimated at 18.2 bats per km2. This contemporary population in the study area is much greater than was indicated in historical records from the 19th century. There was no evidence that the populations of pipistrelles, near to the northern border of their distribution. was reduced when compared with populations further south. Thirty-four of the roosts were occupied by brown long-eared bats. These roosts were located predominantly along a short (25 km), well wooded section of the River Dee. The mean roost size in early summer for brown long-eared bats was 16.8 individuals. On average, these roosts were predominantly female (69.6%, n = 273), but contained a variable proportion of immature and occasionally mature males. The density of brown long-eared bats in the occupied habitat was 1.66 bats per km2, less than a tenth the density of pipistrelles. Historically, this bat was more widespread and abundant in the area. There were only four identified roosts of Daubenton's bats, containing in total about 300 individuals. In all these cases, the roosts were located immediately adjacent to the major rivers, and in two of the cases were also close to areas of open water. A survey of 72 bridges in the area revealed only two individual Daubenton's bats. The density of Daubenton's bats in the occupied habitat was around 2.4 bats per kM2. There has been a substantial reduction in the population of this bat in the area over historical times. At the turn of the century it was the commonest bat in the area, but currently it is the rarest. The causes of the decline are uncertain but are unlikely to reflect draining of areas of open water or the activities of anglers.},

In this paper an empirical method which overcomes these analytical difficulties is used to examine the functional nature of the pattern of bat emergence. The emergence behaviour from two large colonies of pipistrelle bats containing between 102 and 976 individual bats was monitored during the summers of 1992 and 1993. Both colonies had two primary exit holes with bats from one hole crossing the face of the second hole. Emergence events at the first hole triggered events at the second hole at both colonies demonstrating that the clumped emergence pattern was not a bottleneck artefact. The extent of clumping was greatest during the first half of the emergence, when light levels were high, suggesting an anti-predation function. This pattern was not a consequence of a higher emergence intensity early in the evening. (C) 1995 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract = {(1) We investigated the effects of a range of stimuli, associated with disturbance by visitors to caves, on the energy expenditure of hibernating bats. (2) Twenty-five individual bats of six species were exposed to 206 separate applications of non-tactile stimuli (head torch, photographic flash, sound, speech, temperature increase). This resulted in only nine significant increases in energy expenditure (4.4%). In contrast, nineteen out of nineteen tactile stimuli, applied to ten individuals of four species, resulted in significant increases in energy expenditure. The difference in frequency of response to the two types of stimulation was highly significant. (3) The extra energy expended by bats in a response following a non-tactile stimulation was low (mean = 49 J). Tactile stimulation resulted in much greater energy expenditure (mean = 2038J). (4) Neither the degree nor the frequency of response to non-tactile stimulation was affected by species, body mass, ambient temperature, season, or metabolic rate during torpor. Degree of response to tactile stimulation increased significantly with increasing body mass. (5) Energy expenditure during torpor (pre-stimulation) was significantly affected by temperature in Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri Kuhl), Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentoni Kuhl), brown long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus L.), and by body mass in these species and pipistrelles (Pipistrellus pipistrellus Schreber). The mean energy expenditure across all species was 6.17 mW. (6) By combining the measured energy expenditure in torpor before stimulation with the increase in energy requirements which accompanied non-tactile and tactile disturbance, the mean maximum reduction in potential duration of hibernation resulting from a non-tactile disturbance which elicited a significant response was 4.5 h, and was 104 h for each tactile disturbance. (7) Each non-tactile disturbance was predicted to decrease fat stores by 0.001 g. Each tactile disturbance was predicted to decrease fat stores by by 0.05 g.},

pages = {134-139},
abstract = {A number of conservation approaches are used to manage threatened species. However, some of these approaches require intensive planning and can often be restricted by funding. Supplementary feeding is a non-invasive and cost-effective approach to manage vulnerable populations, but we lack data on its usefulness. Here we investigated the effects of supplementary feeding on a population of red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris), a UK priority species which faces competition from the non-native grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). The study took place October-December 2015, lasting 8 weeks. Twenty feeders were installed 1 week prior to the beginning of the study in a protected woodland free from grey squirrels, either containing food (full feeders) or no food (empty feeders), and squirrel abundance before and after feeding was recorded at each feeder (for a total of 27 feeding and recording events). Six times more squirrels were seen at full feeders, and numbers increased by 7 fold after feeding. We also observed that the activity of red squirrels in the vicinity of full feeders increased during the course of the study. Eighty-five hair samples were collected during the study, all of which were found at full feeders. Results demonstrate red squirrels can differentiate between full and empty feeders, suggesting their awareness increases when supplementary food is present. Increased abundance of squirrels at full feeders after feeding times not only implies that squirrels are attracted to and can benefit by supplementation, it also shows that food supplementation can be used to regulate the movement of individuals across habitats. Understanding how red squirrel populations are affected by supplementary feeding will contribute towards existing conservation efforts to improve this species future survival.

abstract = {The effects of detector height and season on bat activity have not been investigated in the UK and are poorly understood globally, yet are crucial to designing effective acoustic activity surveys. The aim of this study was to test predictions of species foraging preferences for the canopy or understorey and to determine whether this pattern shows seasonal variation. Bat activity was recorded using automated detectors in the canopy and understorey of an ancient broadleaved woodland in south-west England in spring and summer for a total of 40 nights. Activity levels were then compared between each of the two detector heights and two seasons. The canopy detector recorded significantly more bat activity overall and recorded significantly higher activity of Nyctalus, Pipistrellus pipistrellus and P pygmaeus compared to the understorey detector. Nyctalus were more frequent in summer compared to spring. Pipistrellus pipistrellus consistently preferred the canopy, whilst P. pygmaeus showed this preference in summer only. Myotis were more frequent in spring compared to summer, favouring the understorey in spring but displaying a marginal preference for the canopy in summer. This suggests that it is advisable to record at multiple heights at different stages of the active season to assess bat activity in woodland. These effects should be tested in other woodland sites in order to determine the consequences of ground-based recording during a limited survey period.},

journal = {Journal of Zoology},
volume = {255},
pages = {191-198},
abstract = {In lowland England, badgers Meles meles form social groups of up to 30 individuals. They share a main den (sett) and a core feeding range, but largely forage alone. Faeces are deposited in discrete hinterland and border 'latrines'. Border latrines are shared with neighbouring groups. We demonstrate that there is a highly significant tendency for neighbouring groups to place a similar quantity of faeces at shared latrines. There are also significant tendencies to place more faeces in boundary latrines close to the sett, and for reduced separation of latrines close to the sett. We also demonstrate that badgers tend to defecate most frequently on the boundary closest to their current feeding site. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that faeces at border latrines are used to promote range exclusion. We propose that faecal volume represents a reliable signal of the encounter likelihood and/or foraging pressure of badgers along a particular border. According to the 'active territorial defence' hypothesis, this indicates a stand-off position in terms of each group's resource holding potential by signalling encounter likelihood across the boundary. By the 'passive range exclusion' hypothesis, this border is an isopleth (equal contour) of resource depletion between groups, and crossing over such a contour deep into a neighbouring range reduces foraging efficiency. By either hypothesis, the matched faecal volume and sett proximity effects suggest a simple mechanism that is capable of allowing reliable information to be passed by individuals between adjacent sectors of neighbouring territories to deter intrusion. This is a 'bottom-up' process of inter-dependent, parallel, individual responses, which is capable of generating the emergent complexity of co-ordinated group ranges without central control.},

abstract = {We investigated the behavioural mechanisms by which European badgers receive and transmit information at shared defecation sites (latrines). We surveyed locations of 143 latrines to establish factors influencing latrine position, and monitored the behaviour of badgers at latrines. Badger latrines were significantly closer to tree trunks than were random samples, and were more likely to be associated with conifers than broadleafs. This may serve to protect scent marks from erosion. Latrines were also placed more closely to linear features than expected; linear features may channel the movements of badgers, promoting discovery of latrines. Within latrines, badgers differed in their placement of faeces and subcaudal scent marks. Faeces were placed in a subset of pits, which were used for several consecutive nights, then abandoned for another subset of pits. Subcaudal scent (squat) marks were positioned in prominent places, and there was no consistent tendency to overmark. Meetings were rare at latrines. Sniffing was the most common behaviour, and was focused on defecation sites. At least three distinct behaviours that appear to serve an information transfer function were observed: squat marking; defecation; and digging and scuffing. Squat marking and defecation were performed by all age and sex classes, and may have a role in cross-territorial communication. Digging and scuffing were associated with mating, and may communicate breeding condition. The wide range of marking behaviours, compounded by the lack of any clearly sex-limited behaviour at latrines, suggests a multiplicity of roles in the social lives of all age and sex classes of badgers.

pages = {560-566},
abstract = {Female common shrews (Sorex araneus) produce large numbers of offspring at enormous energetic cost. Moreover, the number of offspring per litter often exceeds the number that are reared to weaning. This is particularly puzzling because there is intense competition for survival among young shrews once they have left the nest. It appears therefore that females could increase their reproductive success by shifting investment from production of apparently surplus offspring to increase investment in those they are able to rear. Here, we suggest that the reason female common shrews invest in apparent overproduction of offspring may be related to patterns of dispersal and inbreeding in this species. Matings between genetically similar individuals occur frequently in natural populations, and females appear unable to avoid costs associated with inbreeding by selecting mates or their sperm on the basis of genetic compatibility. Production of more offspring than are weaned, coupled with multiple mating, may therefore be a strategy to promote sibling competition for maternal investment and hence selection of the most genetically fit young from mixed paternity litters.},

abstract = {Three hypotheses concerning potential genetic benefits of female multiple mating behaviour are evaluated for the common shrew. In a high-density population, many successful copulations took place between individuals estimated to be close relatives (e.g. full or half siblings). Juveniles resulting from such matings tended to be relatively small at weaning, and were generally less likely to survive to sexual maturity than more outbred individuals. Multiple paternity was discovered in eight of nine litters examined. The incidence of matings between close relatives, the cost of inbreeding, and the high incidence of multiple paternity presented are each consistent with the hypothesis that female multiple mating is a strategy to reduce inbreeding. That is, if females cannot always distinguish close kin, then they may copulate with several different males and so reduce the risk that all their offspring will be sired by a close relative.},

abstract = {The common shrew (Sorer araneus) is a solitary small mammal with a promiscuous mating system. Previous studies of this species suggest that females typically mate multiply, and that males may adopt alternative mate-searching tactics. We studied two generations of common shrews in a population near Oxford, England. Males were found to adopt two different mate-searching tactics. Those classed as type A occupied relatively small exclusive ranges during March, and made repeated long-distance movements to visit female ranges around the time of first oestrus in April. Males classed as type B established large overlapping ranges in areas of relatively high female density during March, and maintained these ranges throughout April. Type B males were larger than type A males at an early stage of sexual maturation, but there was no difference in the adult body size of the two types of male. Type A males had significantly higher epididymal sperm counts than type B males. Paternity analyses of litters born during the first year of the study reveal that the mean number of offspring fathered by type B males was greater than the mean number fathered by type A males. It is concluded that different mate-searching tactics may be conditional upon the timing of sexual maturation. Differences in sperm production are discussed in relation to sperm competition theory.},

abstract = {Male common shrews (Sorer araneus) adopt two discrete mating tactics. The most successful males, in terms of number of offspring fathered, are those that establish large overlapping home ranges in areas of high female density early in the breeding season. An alternative, less successful mating tactic is to travel long distances in search of mating opportunities. This study is an investigation of correlates of reproductive success for males adopting these different mating tactics. Reproductive success under natural conditions was assessed using DNA fingerprinting, and survival of offspring was monitored in the field. The number of offspring fathered by males with overlapping home ranges was positively correlated with the number of female ranges overlapped during the breeding season and with testes mass. The number of offspring fathered by males that made long-distance movements was positively correlated with their epididymal sperm counts. It is argued that competitively superior (overlapping) males achieve high reproductive success by competing to maximize the number of females inseminated, whereas those adopting an alternative mating tactic instead compete largely via sperm competition, aiming to maximize insemination success with any particular female. There was no significant difference in the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of males adopting different mating tactics (FA was measured as the difference in length of the paired lateral scent glands). Fluctuating asymmetry was not related to the number of offspring fathered by males adopting either mating tactic, but was significantly correlated with the proportion of male offspring fathered that survived to sexual maturity. Although apparently not correlated with mating success in this species, EA may reflect some aspect of genetic quality that affects offspring survival.},

abstract = {Light pollution is a major emerging issue in biodiversity conservation, and has important implications for policy development and strategic planning. Although research is now addressing the negative impacts of anthropogenic noise on biota, less attention has been paid to the effects of light pollution. Changes in lighting technology have led to a diverse range of emerging low energy light types and a trend towards the increased use of white light. Light pollution affects ecological interactions across a range of taxa and has adverse effects on behaviours such as foraging, reproduction and communication. Almost a quarter of bat species globally are threatened and the key underlying threat to populations is pressure on resources from increasing human populations. Being nocturnal, bats are among the taxa most likely to be affected by light pollution. In this paper we provide an overview of the current trends in artificial lighting followed by a review of the current evidence of the impacts of lighting on bat behaviour, particularly foraging, commuting, emergence, roosting and hibernation. We discuss taxon-specific effects and potential cumulative ecosystem level impacts. We conclude by summarising some potential strategies to minimise the impacts of lighting on bats and identify key gaps in knowledge and priority areas for future research.

abstract = {Artificial lighting is a key biodiversity threat and produces 1900 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions globally, more than three times that produced by aviation. The need to meet climate change targets has led to a global increase in energy-efficient light sources such as high-brightness light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Despite the energetic benefits of LEDs, their ecological impacts have not been tested. Using an experimental approach, we show that LED street lights caused a reduction in activity of slow-flying bats ( Rhinolophus hipposideros and Myotis spp.). Both R. hipposideros and Myotis spp. activities were significantly reduced even during low light levels of 3.6 similar to lux. There was no effect of LED lighting on the relatively fast-flying Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Nyctalus/Eptesicus spp. We provide the first evidence of the effects of LED lights on bats. Despite having considerable energy-saving benefits, LED lights can potentially fragment commuting routes for bats with associated negative conservation consequences. Our results add to the growing evidence of negative impacts of lighting on a wide range of taxa. We highlight the complexities involved in simultaneously meeting targets for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. New lighting strategies should integrate climate change targets with the cultural, social and ecological impacts of emerging lighting technologies.},

pages = {1324-1334},
abstract = {The Convention on Biological Diversity has catalyzed worldwide awareness of threats to biological diversity and stimulated global conservation strategies. These have led to national and international legislation and have generated debate about the most effective conservation actions. Under the EU Habitats Directive, all member states are obliged to establish a system for strict protection of species listed in Annex IV(a), which includes all bats. In England, this obligation has resulted in legislation that allows for derogation from strict protection under license, provided activities are undertaken to mitigate any potential negative effects on bat numbers. We used an evidence-based approach to assess the cost-effectiveness of mitigation strategies and the English bat-derogation licensing process as a whole. We analyzed data from 389 bat derogation licenses issued in England from 2003 to 2005 relating to 1776 roosts and 15 species to determine the nature and extent of development and mitigation activities and their effects on bats. Overall the effects of licensed activities on roosts were negative. Despite the level of protection afforded to bats, the majority (68%) of roosts for which derogation licenses were issued were destroyed. There were species-specific differences in the probability of roosts being destroyed, and impacts on roosts did not reflect a species' conservation status. Information provided by licensees was inadequate and inconsistent. Most licensees (67%) failed to submit postdevelopment reports, and postdevelopment monitoring was conducted at only 19% of sites. Despite a minimum of 4.13 million spent on mitigation structures for bats from 2003 to 2005, it was unclear whether the licensing process meets EU obligations. On the basis of our results, we believe there is a need to overhaul the licensing process, to establish a comprehensive, standardized postdevelopment monitoring system, and to demonstrate that mitigation is commensurate with Britain's legal obligations.},

abstract = {Temporal changes in phenological traits arising as a consequence of recent rapid environmental change have been widely demonstrated in animal populations. Increasingly, studies are seeking to understand the impact of changes in such traits on individual fitness and population dynamics, with the ultimate aim of predicting population persistence or extinction under different climate scenarios. Here, we examined the effects of environmental change on maternal reproductive traits in a wild population of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and sought to explain why, despite a rapid advance in offspring birth dates, we observed no apparent consequences for offspring fitness. By using path analysis, we identified both direct and indirect paths along which changes in environmental conditions affected birth date, birth mass, juvenile survival, and female fecundity. In general, warmer temperatures were associated with earlier birth dates and greater birth mass, and higher rainfall was associated with reduced juvenile survival and reduced female fecundity. We also examined concurrent effects of population density, maternal age, and reproductive history, and found that temporal stasis in average trait values, at least in part, could be explained by antagonistic roles of direct and indirect effects of changing climate and increasing population density. Identification of the many mechanisms that contribute to the dynamics of phenotypic traits is challenging; this study demonstrates the need to consider both climatic and demographic variation in order to understand the fitness consequences of changes in phenological traits.},

abstract = {In polygynous mammals, most variance in male reproductive success is expected to result from competition between males, and the role of female behavior remains poorly understood. Contests between red deer males during the annual rut are one of the most famous examples of male-male competition. However, anecdotal evidence suggests females in estrus make substantial movements, changing harems, and potentially disrupting the outcome of male contests. In other polygynous mammals, such movements have been interpreted as evidence of female mating preferences. Here, we use 34 years of detailed observational data on wild red deer to show that 43% of estrous females are found in different harems between successive observations and that 64% of such females make substantial movements (up to 4 km) when this occurs. Approximately 45% of these movements result in the male into whose harem a female moved fathering her offspring. We then test whether females move nonrandomly with respect to male phenotype, consistent with the hypothesis that females move to mate with preferred males. Although in general, females were more likely to be found in larger harems and the harems of younger males after harem changes, these effects were not specific to estrous females. Further, estrous females were not more likely to be found in the harems of less related males. We therefore find little support for the idea that estrous females move between harems to mate with a preferred male; as a result, the reasons females make such extraordinary movements when in estrus remain unclear.},

abstract = {Variation between individuals is an essential component of natural selection and evolutionary change, but it is only recently that the consequences of persistent differences between individuals on population dynamics have been considered. In particular, few authors have addressed whether interactions exist between individual quality and environmental variation. In part, this is due to the difficulties of collecting sufficient data, but also the challenge of defining individual quality. Using a long-established study population of red deer, Cervus elaphus, inhabiting the North Block of the Isle of Rum, and three quality measures, this paper investigates how differences in maternal quality affect variation in birth body mass and date, as population density varies, and how this differs depending on the sex of the offspring and the maternal quality measure used. Significant interactions between maternal quality, measured as a hind's total contribution to population growth, and population density are reported for birth mass, but only for male calves. Analyses using dominance or age at primiparity to define maternal quality showed no significant interactions with population density, highlighting the difficulties of defining a consistent measure of individual quality.},

abstract = {Social structure, limited dispersal, and spatial heterogeneity in resources are ubiquitous in wild vertebrate populations. As a result, relatives share environments as well as genes, and environmental and genetic sources of similarity between individuals are potentially confounded. Quantitative genetic studies in the wild therefore typically account for easily captured shared environmental effects (e.g., parent, nest, or region). Fine-scale spatial effects are likely to be just as important in wild vertebrates, but have been largely ignored. We used data from wild red deer to build animal models to estimate additive genetic variance and heritability in four female traits (spring and rut home range size, offspring birth weight, and lifetime breeding success). We then, separately, incorporated spatial autocorrelation and a matrix of home range overlap into these models to estimate the effect of location or shared habitat on phenotypic variation. These terms explained a substantial amount of variation in all traits and their inclusion resulted in reductions in heritability estimates, up to an order of magnitude up for home range size. Our results highlight the potential of multiple covariance matrices to dissect environmental, social, and genetic contributions to phenotypic variation, and the importance of considering fine-scale spatial processes in quantitative genetic studies.},

abstract = {The Scottish Government has announced that they are minded to allow reintroduced populations of Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber), an ecosystem engineer, to remain in Scotland. Some species and habitats of conservation importance may be affected by the activities of an ecosystem engineer. The study had two key objectives: to identify the potential location of the beaver's two ecosystem engineering activities and to assess risks to vulnerable habitats and species. To identify potential core beaver woodland, a rule-based species distribution model was developed which included a novel method of integrating beaver territory size requirements. This was used to further predict where beavers would be unlikely to dam. We used the models to assess the spatial overlap between ecosystem engineering activities (i.e. herbivory and damming) with habitats and species of conservation importance. One hundred and five thousand five hundred eighty-six hectares of core beaver woodland was identified, which predicted the location of beaver herbivory. Our model successfully predicted the location of beaver activities surveyed in the largest beaver population in Scotland. Extensive overlap was predicted between beaver herbivory and habitats of conservation importance, in particular aspen woodland, Atlantic hazelwood, and alluvial forests. Eighty-seven percent of watercourses in Scotland were outside the beaver damming model, and hence had a lower likelihood of being dammed. The majority of freshwater pearl mussel, lamprey and Atlantic salmon Special Areas of Conservation, were in river sections less likely to be dammed. If beavers recolonise their former range in Scotland, ecosystem engineering activities are likely to be extensive. However, any impacts on vulnerable species and habitats will be in specific areas and will need to be monitored.},

abstract = {In Scotland, UK, beavers became extinct about 400years ago. Currently, two wild populations are present in Scotland on a trial basis, and the case for their full reintroduction is currently being considered by Scottish ministers. Beavers are widely considered ecosystem engineers'. Indeed, beavers have large impacts on the environment, fundamentally change ecosystems, and create unusual habitats, often considered unique. In this review, we investigate the mechanisms by which beavers act as ecosystem engineers, and then discuss the possible impacts of beavers on the biodiversity of Scotland. A meta-analysis of published studies on beavers' interactions with biodiversity was conducted, and the balance of positive and negative interactions with plants, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals recorded. The meta-analysis showed that, overall, beavers have an overwhelmingly positive influence on biodiversity. Beavers' ability to modify the environment means that they fundamentally increase habitat heterogeneity. As beavers are central-place foragers that feed only in close proximity to watercourses, their herbivory is unevenly spread in the landscape. In addition, beaver ponds and their associated unique successional stages increase habitat heterogeneity both spatially and temporally. Beavers also influence the ecosystems through the creation of a variety of features such as dams and lodges, important habitat features such as standing dead wood (after inundation), an increase in woody debris, and a graded edge between terrestrial and aquatic habitats that is rich in structural complexity. In Scotland, a widespread positive influence on biodiversity is expected, if beavers are widely reintroduced. For instance, beaver activity should provide important habitat for the otter Lutra lutra, great crested newt Triturus cristatus and water vole Arvicola amphibious, all species of conservation importance. Beavers are most likely to have detrimental impacts on certain woodland habitats and species of conservation importance, such as the Atlantic hazelwood climax community and aspen Populus tremula woodland. A lack of woodland regeneration caused by high deer abundance could lead to habitat degradation or loss. These are also of particular importance due to the variety of associated dependent species of conservation interest, such as lichen communities in Atlantic hazelwoods.},

abstract = {The Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) population in the British Isles increased rapidly from the 1800s to 1950 due to climatic amelioration, predator reduction and agricultural changes. It became the major vertebrate pest of agriculture, causing an estimated £50 million in damage and lost production each year. Myxomatosis reached Britain in 1954‐55 causing 99‐9% mortality in some Rabbit populations and, carried by the mosquito and flea vectors, the disease spread rapidly. The consequent decline in the Rabbit population caused dramatic changes in agriculture and the native fauna and flora. It promoted woodland regeneration and increased grassland and cereal production; herb and grass height increased, flowering was noticeable and plant successions ensued. Some small legumes and annual plants became extinct locally and much floristically rich vegetation became dominated by a few grass species or shrubs. The increased grass growth probably promoted an increase in the number of many invertebrate species as well as in the vole (Microrus agrestis) . Some species of insect became reduced in number and the Large Blue Butterfly (Maculinea arion) has become extinct (1979) since the decline of the ant (Myrmica spp.) fauna necessary to rear the butterfly larvae. Breeding sites for the Sand Lizard (Lacerta ugilis) , Stone Curlew (Burhinus oedicnemus) and Wheatear (Oenanrhe oenanthe) have been reduced by habitat change. Immediately after myxomatosis many predator populations suffered from a lack of Rabbit prey with consequent poor breeding success, but those able to switch to voles, and other predators which are no longer taken in Rabbit trapping, have increased in numbers, e.g. Fox (Vulpes vulpes) , Polecat (Mustela putorius) , Short‐eared Owl (Asio Barnmeus) and Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) . Others such as the Stoat (Mustela ermineu) and the Buzzard (Buteo buteo) declined immediately after myxomatosis through lack of prey and have recovered in nubers only slowly; the Peregrine falcon population has declined partly as a result of lack of open habitat. The breeding success of many predators was also reduced. Parasites of the Rabbit also declined; the flea (Spilopsyllus cuniculi) , roundworms and tapeworms, as well as coccidiosis carried by Rabbits and particularly affecting young hares (Lepus europaeus) were all considered to be affected. Species such as the Pheasant Phasianus spp., the hare and the Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus) increased their use of woodland habitat and/or benefited from the increased food available. Rats (Rartus nomegicus) appeared to decline following increased predation and loss of habitat.

In Australia similar vegetational changes occurred in many areas after the introduction of myxomatosis and predators such as the Fox and Wedge‐tailed Eagle (Aquila audax) were reduced by control measures following increased predation on sheep. Many bird and marsupial species were reduced in number after the loss of Rabbit prey or on becoming an alternative prey item.

In Britain the loss of the fur industry has been outweighed economically by the increased agricultural production and reduced control and maintenance costs following myxomatosis. Since myxomatosis appeared Rabbit numbers have increased only slowly, probably because of increased predator pressure on low density populations and the periodic recurrence of the disease. Rabbit behaviour may have changed so that burrows are not used as much as in the past, Rabbit trapping has ceased and many habitats have been lost. Rabbit numbers could still reach moderate densities but a reversal of many of the ecological effects of my xomatosis is unlikely.},

abstract = {Neophobia (fear of new stimuli) is an important component of mammalian behavioural ecology. In addition, information on neophobia in pest species could be of great significance in targetting control measures and predicting changes in responses to them. Novel objects and an auditory stimulus were presented to individually marked wild rabbits living socially in clumped warrens in southern British farmland. Avoidance of stimuli was measured by scan sampling of rabbits' locations, in replicated experiments. Rabbits avoided a variety of novel objects by staying below ground, and by changing their activity ranges. Responses to different stimuli were correlated within individuals. There were non-significant differences in the degree of avoidance elicited by novel visual stimuli. The most important factors in avoidance were distance from the stimulus, number of previous presentations, and rabbit identity. Individual characteristics, including sex, social rank, and trappability, were less important determinants of neophobia, although dominant females were significantly more neophobic than were non-dominant ones. Only one or two presentations were required for attenuation of avoidance, so novel objects would be of limited application to crop protection. However, equipment used for delivering control measures should also quickly become accepted by rabbits. The measured avoidance and its attenuation indicate that rabbits assessed and responded to their surroundings with high precision, with significant individual variation consistent over stimuli.},

Individuals departed from, and returned to, roosts in groups of 2-6, and circling behaviour was repeated on returning to the roost. During pregnancy, bats from a nursery roost made one flight each per night. This increased to an average maximum of 1.84 early in lactation and then decreased again to one around weaning.

abstract = {<title content-type="main">Abstract High deer populations threaten the conservation value of woodlands and grasslands, but predicting the success of deer culling, in terms of allowing vegetation to recover, is difficult. Numerical simulation modeling is one approach to gain insight into the outcomes of management scenarios. We develop a spatially explicit model to predict the responses of Betula spp. to red deer (Cervus elaphus) and land management in the Scottish Highlands. Our model integrates a Bayesian stochastic stage-based matrix model within the framework of a widely used individual-based forest simulation model, using data collected along spatial and temporal gradients in deer browsing. By initializing our model with the historical spatial locations of trees, we find that densities of juvenile trees (<3m tall) predicted after 9-13years closely match counts observed in the field. This is among the first tests of the accuracy of a dynamical simulation model for predicting the responses of tree regeneration to herbivores. We then test the relative importance of deer browsing, ground cover vegetation, and seed availability in facilitating landscape-level birch regeneration using simulations in which we varied these three variables. We find that deer primarily control transitions of birch to taller (>3m) height tiers over 30years, but regeneration also requires suitable ground cover for seedling establishment. Densities of adult seed sources did not influence regeneration, nor did an active management scenario where we altered the spatial configuration of adults by creating woodland islets. Our results show that managers interested in maximizing tree regeneration cannot simply reduce deer densities but must also improve ground cover for seedling establishment, and the model we develop now enables managers to quantify explicitly how much both these factors need to be altered. More broadly, our findings emphasize the need for land managers to consider the impacts of large herbivores rather than their densities.},

Voles were not recorded on set-aside until 9 months after establishment, and populations only began to increase after nearly 2 years.

abstract = {1. Farmland is readily divisible into linear habitats such as hedges, and non-linear habitats such as fields and woodlots. In agricultural landscapes, conservationists have generally focused on enhancing linear habitats, but there are few data from which to judge whether or not this is a good strategy for biodiversity. 2. We investigated whether the linear or non-linear character of habitat patches, mediated by edge effects, has an impact on the abundance, diversity and richness of the small mammal communities that live within and between them. 3. In particular, we hypothesized, first, that edge effects cause narrow linear habitats to be avoided by specialists such as the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus , but not by generalists such as the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus ; secondly, that edge effects lead to specialists being present in atypical habitat, through excursions at the interface between two habitats. 4. We tested these hypotheses by live-trapping small mammals in grids in the centres of three non-linear farmland habitats (woodlots, set-aside and crop fields) and in field boundaries consisting of a series of adjoining linear habitats. We compared mammal communities in the non-linear habitats with the field boundary as a whole, and with the individual linear habitat elements within the boundary. 5. There was no evidence that specialists avoided linear habitats. Indeed, the field boundary was the most species-rich habitat surveyed, and bank voles were more abundant in linear hedgerow than in non-linear woodland. Bank voles were present in linear set-aside and in the crop edge, but never in non-linear blocks of set-aside or crop, implying that they diffused out of the hedgerow into the adjacent habitats. There was no evidence of an effect of habitat linearity on field voles Microtus agrestis , wood mice or common shrews Sorex araneus . 6. Our results suggest that on uncropped land such as set-aside, the linear or non-linear character of habitats will make little difference to small mammal abundance and diversity. We advocate similar assessments for other taxa so that the effects of farm management and habitat configuration on biodiversity can be understood more fully.},

In agricultural landscapes, conservationists have generally focused on enhancing linear habitats, but there are few data from which to judge whether or not this is a good strategy for biodiversity. 2. We investigated whether the linear or non-linear character of habitat patches, mediated by edge effects, has an impact on the abundance, diversity and richness of the small mammal communities that live within and between them. 3. In particular, we hypothesized, first, that edge effects cause narrow linear habitats to be avoided by specialists such as the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus , but not by generalists such as the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus ; secondly, that edge effects lead to specialists being present in atypical habitat, through excursions at the interface between two habitats. 4. We tested these hypotheses by live-trapping small mammals in grids in the centres of three non-linear farmland habitats (woodlots, set-aside and crop fields) and in field boundaries consisting of a series of adjoining linear habitats. We compared mammal communities in the non-linear habitats with the field boundary as a whole, and with the individual linear habitat elements within the boundary. 5. There was no evidence that specialists avoided linear habitats. Indeed, the field boundary was the most species-rich habitat surveyed, and bank voles were more abundant in linear hedgerow than in non-linear woodland. Bank voles were present in linear set-aside and in the crop edge, but never in non-linear blocks of set-aside or crop, implying that they diffused out of the hedgerow into the adjacent habitats. There was no evidence of an effect of habitat linearity on field voles Microtus agrestis , wood mice or common shrews Sorex araneus . 6. Our results suggest that on uncropped land such as set-aside, the linear or non-linear character of habitats will make little difference to small mammal abundance and diversity. We advocate similar assessments for other taxa so that the effects of farm management and habitat configuration on biodiversity can be understood more fully.},

abstract = {Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus are potentially useful indicators of change in arable ecosystems. Here we focus on changes resulting from removal of land from arable production under the set-aside scheme. Wood mice were radio-tracked to compare: (a) their use of set-aside. crop and hedgerow before and after harvest; (b) set-aside configured as margins and as a 3 ha block; (c) cut and uncut 20-m wide set-aside margins. Males had larger home ranges, and were more mobile than females. Ranges were larger, and animals more mobile. before harvest than afterwards. There were no differences in range sizes of breeding and nonbreeding animals after harvest, suggesting that changes in habitat use were not a function of cessation of breeding. Before harvest, wood mice used habitats within their ranges at random, and their ranges contained a high proportion of cropped area. After harvest they preferred hedgerow and avoided margin set-aside within their ranges, but did not similarly avoid the set-aside block. The proportion of cropped area within their ranges decreased after harvest, and the proportion of margin increased. Our evidence suggests wood mice avoided using the area adjacent to the hedgerow, perhaps to avoid predators. Uncut set-aside patches were favoured and cut patches avoided, possibly in response to differences in food availability and levels of protection from predators. These results confirm that wood mice are useful indicators of change in arable landscapes.},

We studied the presence of small mammals on one-year set-aside through a summer harvest period (278 captures in 3000 trap nights). Trapping success was low on all set-aside (0.6%), but was higher in adjoining hedgerow (30%) and cereal crops (13%). Wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus (Linnaeus, 1758) were the most commonly caught species, and the only species to occur on set-aside. There were no significant differences in trap success between set-aside configured in blocks and strips, nor between sown and naturally regenerated set-aside. Captures on set-aside increased after harvest, when the crop no longer provided cover. Our data demonstrate that set-aside is not necessarily a suitable habitat for small mammals.},

journal = {Physiological and Biochemical Zoology},
volume = {86},
number = {1},
pages = {9-18},
abstract = {Low temperatures in northern winters are energetically challenging for mammals, and a special energetic burden is expected for diminutive species like shrews, which are among the smallest of mammals. Surprisingly, shrews shrink their body size in winter and reduce body and brain mass, an effect known as Dehnel's phenomenon, which is suggested to lower absolute energy intake requirements and thereby enhance survival when food availability is low. Yet reduced body size coupled with higher body-surface-to-mass ratio in these tiny mammals may result in thermoregulatory heat production at a given temperature constituting a larger proportion of the total energy expenditure. To evaluate energetic consequences of reduced body size in winter, we investigated common shrews Sorex araneus in northeastern Poland. Average body mass decreased by 19.0% from summer to winter, and mean skull depth decreased by 13.1%. There was no difference in Dehnel's phenomenon between years despite different weather conditions. The whole-animal thermal conductance (proportional to absolute heat loss) in shrews was 19% lower in winter than in summer; the difference between the two seasons remained significant after correcting for body mass and was caused by improved fur insulation in winter. Thermogenic capacity of shrews, although much enhanced in winter, did not reach its full potential of increase, and this corresponded with relatively mild subnivean temperatures. These findings indicate that, despite their small body size, shrews effectively decrease their costs of thermoregulation. The recorded decrease in body mass from summer to winter resulted in a reduction of overall resting metabolic rate (in thermoneutrality) by 18%. This, combined with the reduced heat loss, should translate to food requirements that are substantially lower than would be the case if shrews did not undergo seasonal decrease in body mass.},

In bank voles, but not wood mice, individuals with high probabilities of infection survived better than uninfected animals. 4. At the level of the population, the effect of infection on survival varied through the year in both species.

We discuss why parasites such as cowpox virus may increase or decrease host survival and why the effect may depend on the time of year.},

abstract = {The distribution of fossorial water voles Arvicola terrestris on 15 small islands in the Sound of Jura, Argyll, Scotland, was established and populations were characterized in terms of size, structure and genetic composition (12 microsatellites). The results are compared with similar data from four metapopulations of riparian water voles in mainland Scotland. Water voles occurred on six islands, one of which was occupied in 1994, but not on two islands occupied during the 1960s. Probability of occupancy was significantly associated with proximity to the nearest occupied island. Unlike voles on the mainland, which occupy fragmented patches of exclusively riparian habitat, voles on islands were fossorial and occupied large areas of continuous habitat. Spring population sizes were c. 10 times higher on the islands than colonies of mainland metapopulations. Individuals from three islands were genotyped and these populations had 50% lower levels of microsatellite polymorphism than the mainland metapopulations. Rates of inferred contemporary dispersal among islands separated by 1 km or more of sea were very low, according to large differences among islands in genetic composition, proportions of coat colour types and incidence of skin infection. None the less, the long-term persistence of the island populations is likely to depend on such dispersal. Comparisons between island populations and mainland metapopulations indicate that in both fragmented systems the level of dispersal is the primary factor influencing genetic structure. The low genetic variability in the island populations may reflect either past historical events (founder effect and genetic drift) or present ecology (lack of immigration in closed and temporally fluctuating populations).},

abstract = {We examined the spatial distribution of water vote populations in four consecutive years and investigated whether the regional population processes of extinction, recolonisation and migration influence distribution and persistence, We examined how such regional processes are influenced by spatial variation in habitat quality. In addition, we assessed the relevance of metapopulation concepts for understanding the dynamics of species that deviate from classical metapopulation assumptions and developing conservation measures for them. Populations were patchy and discrete, and the patchy distribution was not static between years. Population turnover occurred even in the absence of predatory mink, which only influenced the network of populations at the end of the study. Most populations were clustered close together in the upper tributaries. Local population persistence was predominantly influenced by population size: large populations were more persistent. Recolonisation rates were influenced by isolation and habitat quality. The isolation estimates which best explained the distribution of water vote populations incorporated straight-line distances, suggesting water votes disperse overland. The distribution of recolonised sites indicated that dispersing votes actively selected habitat on the basis of its quality. Water votes depart from some of the assumptions made by frequently used metapopulation models. In particular there is no clear binary distinction between suitable and non-suitable habitat. Accounting for variation in habitat quality before investigating temporal changes in population distribution allowed us to demonstrate that the key metapopulation processes were important. The significance of regional population processes relative to local population processes may have increased in declining, fragmented populations compared to pristine regional populations. We hypothesise that although mink predation is likely to eventually cause regional extinction in many areas, metapopulation processes have delayed this decline. Consequently, conservation measures should take into account mink predation rates and regional population processes, before considering aspects of habitat quality.},

abstract = {The effects of cereal harvesting on the ecology of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus were investigated at three arable study sites in Oxfordshire from 1987 to 1991 using both radio-tracking and live-trapping methodologies. The process of harvesting itself had little direct effect on the mice, but the removal of the cover afforded by the crop greatly increased predation pressure on the mice. After harvest, mice either emigrated from the arable ecosystem or reduced activity. Nevertheless, over half (17 of 32) of the mice radio-collared before harvest were taken by predators in the first week following harvest. Together with emigration, this produced an 80% decrease in the population. Post-harvest activities such as stubble burning subsequently further increased mortality. The dramatic increase in prey availability may benefit predators of small mammals in the cereal ecosystem such as tawny owls Strix aluco and weasels Mustela nivalis.},

Home range overlap was significantly greater between males, and between males and females, than it was between females. Overlap between males tended to be greatest in heavily utilised areas. Except during sexual consortship, there was minimal evidence of dynamic interaction among individuals. Home range sizes of breeding males varied widely, as did their body weights. There was no relationship between male body weight and home range size or any other movement parameter. However, males with the largest home ranges had the highest scores on all other movement parameters, indicating that they expended more energy in movement. These more 'vigorous' males had access to the home ranges of more females than did males with small home ranges.},

abstract = {1. This paper examines the consequences to wood mice of selectively reducing the application of herbicides to the outer 6 m of cereal crops ('conservation headlands'). Conservation headlands are known to benefit gamebird populations, via an increase in the abundance of those invertebrates which are the preferred food of gamebird chicks, and also to benefit a variety of arable plant and animal species. 2. Since arable-dwelling wood mice feed on many of the plant and animal species known to increase from conservation headlands, we hypothesized that conservation headlands would increase the natural food available to wood mice and thereby affect their behaviour. 3. To test this hypothesis the application of herbicides onto the headlands of winter wheat fields was manipulated experimentally at two study sites over 3 years. The effects on the movement patterns of 32 wood mice were investigated by intensive radio-tracking. 4. Reduced application of herbicides in small (10 x 20 m) experimental plots along the field headland produced increases in both floral and invertebrate abundance. 5. Wood mice actively sought those headland plots with experimentally elevated food abundance. utilizing reduced-spray plots in preference to both normally sprayed field headlands and the mid-field area.},

Plant species' abundance and the composition of the seed bank were assessed in quadrats taken in areas in which (a) mice foraged, (b) through which mice travelled, or (c) at random within each home range. Wood mice avoided foraging in areas with a high abundance of bare earth, and selected areas with a high abundance of Alopecurus myosuroides, Stellaria media, Avena fatua, Galium aparine or Bromus sterilis. The food plants apparently selected by wood mice differed markedly between months and between sexes. This may relate to the energetic and nutritional demands incurred by the contrasting reproductive tactics of male and female wood mice. There were no differences between seed bank samples taken from quadrats where the mice foraged, travelled through, or which were selected at random. Our study, the first large-scale analysis of wood mouse microhabitat preference using radio-tracking, reveals that whereas the mice do not react to heterogeneity on the scale of the mosaic of crop fields, they are greatly influenced by the dispersion of food plants within the superficially homogeneous crop itself.},

abstract = {Diurnal habitat use by fallow deer Dama dama was studied between 1986-9 by direct observations from transects of eight populations in sites of differing environmental structure and composition. Sites chosen differed in the overall proportion of woodland cover, and ranged from virtually continuous woodland areas in the New Forest, southern England, to open agricultural sites with only scattered woodland copses. Within both New Forest and agricultural areas, individuals in male groups and female groups showed similar patterns of habitat use. In the New Forest, the habitat used most overall by both sexes was open woodland, with extensive use also made of grassland, woodland clearings and closed woodland. In agricultural areas, most extensive use was made of closed woodland, with open woodland, arable land and grassland used to a lesser extent. Individuals in mixed-sex groups in the New Forest but not in agricultural areas made more extensive use of grasslands than those in single-sex groups. Individuals in female groups in the New Forest showed pronounced seasonal variation in habitat use with utilization of open woodland higher in autumn and winter and grassland higher in spring and summer. Individuals in female groups in agricultural areas showed little seasonal variation in habitat use. There were insufficient data to investigate seasonal variation in habitat use by individuals in male and mixed-sex groups. Availability of habitat types varied widely between study sites. Use of either open or closed woodland remained high in each site reflecting increased selection for woodland resources when they were of limited availability. Fallow deer appeared able to satisfy their ecological and behavioural requirements from a variety of environments through: (i) changing strength of selection of particular habitats to compensate for differing availability; and Oil substitution of one habitat in one area for a different habitat in another area which offered the same effective resources. This flexibility in resource use parallels observed plasticity in other aspects of fallow behavioural ecology.},

abstract = {Grouping patterns in fallow deer Dama dama were studied between 1986-9 by direct observation from transects of eight populations in the New Forest and adjacent agricultural land in southern England. Study populations were chosen on the basis of pronounced differences in population density, sex ratio, and dispersion, and differences between the sites in habitat availability and patterns of habitat use. Within both forest and agricultural study sites, a large majority of female deer was observed in single sex female groups throughout the year. The lowest levels of female segregation occurred during the autumn reproductive period. Males generally exhibited lower levels of sexual segregation than females, particularly during winter and spring In the forest sites, winter and spring mixed-sex groups were largely the result of young males joining female feeding aggregations. In contrast, mixed-sex groups in agricultural sites contained mature males throughout the year and were not exclusively based on habitats used for feeding. There was a negative correlation between the extent of winter and spring male segregation and population sex ratio, suggesting that males join female groups when male densities are relatively low. Female group size varied seasonally in all sites, attaining maximum values in winter or spring and minimum values in summer or autumn. This was not a reflection of changing patterns of habitat use; group size varied seasonally in both open and closed habitats. Female groups were larger in open habitats than in closed habitats throughout the year. The size of female groups varied between the study sites but there were no clear differences in overall female group size between the forest and agricultural sites. There was a tendency for open habitat group size to be largest in the forest sites and closed habitat group size to be largest in the agricultural sites. Female group size overall was unrelated to the proportion of each site occupied by closed habitat. However, an increase in the amount of closed habitat was reflected by a decrease in closed habitat group size. Female group size overall was negatively related to the use of closed habitat; not surprisingly, an increase in use of open habitats resulted in increased overall group size. Female group size overall was not related to density; large groups occurred in both high and low density sites. However, in high density populations, open habitat group size was larger and closed habitat group size smaller than in low density populations.},

Hedgerow ranked highest in preference (as distinct from use) for all comparisons made in both winter and summer. In winter, home ranges contained significantly more hedgerow than barley and wheat, and significantly more rape than wheat. Animals also used the habitats within their home ranges non-randomly, with a significant preference for hedgerow. In summer, home ranges contained significantly less rape than other habitats. Habitats within home ranges were used at random. Seasonal patterns in habitat use appeared to be largely a response to seasonal disturbance and the availability of cover in the fields.},

abstract = {Foraging in Daubenton's bats Myotis daubentonii, at two altitudinal locations along a river gradient in North Wales was investigated in relation to aerial insect density and to the density of prey on the water surface. Prey capture in Daubenton's bats consisted of aerial hawking, where prey was taken in the air, and trawling, where bats gaffed invertebrates from the water surface. Aerial hawking accounted for 86% of all prey capture attempts, despite aerial insect availability falling close to zero for much of the night. Conversely, prey density on the water surface was an order of magnitude higher than aerial prey density and increased through the night due to aquatic invertebrate drift. At the higher altitude site, M. daubentonii switched prey capture strategy to gaffing, possibly to reflect this change in prey availability on the water's surface, but at the lower altitude site, they maintained aerial hawking as the preferred strategy. The switch to gaffing may be inhibited by the significant downstream accumulation of large numbers of inedible exuviae of caddis flies, Trichoptera, at the low-altitude site, which form both acoustic clutter and increase the probability of capturing inedible prey, making foraging less efficient. These small altitudinal differences in foraging strategy should be factored into the design of future altitudinal bat foraging studies and if found to be a widespread strategy, taken into consideration by conservation planners when reviewing the habitat requirements of Daubenton's bats in river valleys within the United Kingdom.},

abstract = {Distribution and abundance of two temperate-zone insectivorous bats, Daubenton's (Myotis daubentonii) and common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), and their potential prey were studied along an altitudinal river gradient in relation to environmental variables including air temperature, wind speed, water surface state, and presence or absence of bank-side trees. Using a Latin square design at ten different habitat combination types, ultrasound recordings and insect sampling were carried out to quantify bat habitat preferences and potential prey abundance and classification. Myotis daubentonii and P. pipistrellus activity was significantly higher over smooth water river sections with trees on either or both banks while cluttered and rapid water sections were avoided. Conversely, insect abundance was not related to water surface condition or the presence or absence of bank-side trees. Nematoceran dipterans made up 98% of insect numbers, with small numbers of brachycerans and cyclorrhaphans. The most common insect families were Chironomidae and Ceratopogonidae. There was no correlation between bat activity and aerial insect activity, suggesting that aerial prey availability is not the sole driver of bat habitat choice. Bat and insect abundance were each correlated positively with night-time air temperature. No bat passes or flying insects were recorded at temperatures < 4 degrees C. At 5 degrees C, only M. daubentonii were observed foraging, and at 6 degrees C there were more M. daubentonii present than any other bat species. No correlation was found between number of bat passes hr(-1) and wind speed, moon visibility, moon phase, and percentage cloud cover. Rain did not affect M. daubentonii, but P. pipistrellus preferred to forage on dry nights. Bats were predicted to forage preferentially where aerial insect abundance was highest but this was found to not be case, and other aspects such as detection of prey against clutter may have an important role to play in habitat choice.},

abstract = {Distributions of Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii), common pipistrelle, (Pipistrellus pipistrellus), and soprano pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pygmaeus) were investigated along and altitudinal gradient of the Lledr River, Conwy, North Wales, and presence assessed in relation to the water surface condition, presence/absence of bank-side trees, and elevation. Ultrasound recordings of bats made on timed transects in summer 1999 were used to quantify habitat usage. All species significantly preferred smooth water sections of the river with trees on either one or both banks; P.pygmaeus also preferred smooth water with no trees. Bats avoided rough and cluttered water areas, as rapids may generate high-frequency echolocation-interfering noise and cluttered areas present obstacles to flight. In lower river regions, detections of bats reflected the proportion of suitable habitat available. At higher elevations, sufficient habitat was available; however, bats were likely restricted due to other factors such as a less predictable food source. This study emphasizes the importance of riparian habitat, bank-side trees, and smooth water as foraging habitat for bats in marginal upland areas until a certain elevation, beyond which bats in these areas likely cease to forage. These small-scale altitudinal differences in habitat selection should be factored in when designing future bat distribution studies and taken into consideration by conservation planners when reviewing habitat requirements of these species in Welsh river valleys, and elsewhere within the United Kingdom.},

abstract = {Farm buildings may offer foraging opportunities for wild mammals, which may result in economic losses and the potential for disease transmission to livestock. Effective management to reduce such risks requires knowledge of the behaviour of wildlife visiting buildings. Remote surveillance was used to monitor red fox (Vulpes vulpes) activity in buildings on cattle farms in Southwest England over a period of 2 years. Frequent visits were observed throughout the year, during which foxes excreted and scent-marked on stored feed. This behaviour carries potential risks of pathogen transmission to cattle. Fox visits were positively correlated with maximum temperature in the preceding 24 h, and were most frequent to buildings where cattle were absent. The frequency of fox visits varied widely amongst farms, potentially reflecting variation in local farm management practices. On some farms, visits were frequent and involved behaviour with the potential to result in contamination of the environment with infectious pathogens. Risks of onward transmission to domestic animals could be managed by imposing tighter biosecurity measures.},

Conservationists are quite rightly concerned with the invasion of exotic organisms such as the grey squirrel. Our work emphasizes that they, along with other ecologists, should pay particular attention to pathogens, even when they occur at low prevalence.},

abstract = {There is a growing awareness that cyclic population dynamics in vertebrate species are driven by a complex set of interactions rather than a single causal factor. While theory suggests that direct host-parasite interactions may destabilise population dynamics, the interaction between host and parasite may also influence population dynamics through indirect effects that result in delayed responses to either density or to life-history traits. Using empirical data on mountain hares (Lepus timidus) infected with a nematode parasite (Trichostrongylus retortaeformis), we developed an individual-based model (IBM) that incorporated direct effects and delayed life-history effects (DLHEs) of a macroparasite, alternative transmission mechanisms and seasonality in host population dynamics. The full model describes mean characteristics of observed mountain hare time series and parasite abundance, but by systematically removing model structure we dissect out dynamic influences of DLHEs. The DLHEs were weakly destabilising, increasing the propensity for cyclic dynamics and suggesting DLHEs could be important processes in host-parasite systems. Further, by modifying model structure we identify a strong influence of parasite transmission mechanism on host population stability, and discuss the implications for parasite aggregation mechanisms, host movement and natural geographical variation in host population dynamics. The effect of T. retortaeformis on mountain hares likely forms part of a complex set of interactions that lead to population cycles. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Understanding the drivers of population fluctuations is a central goal of ecology. Although well-established theory suggests that parasites can drive cyclic population fluctuations in their hosts, field evidence is lacking. Theory predicts that a parasite that loosely aggregates in the host population and has stronger impact on host fecundity than survival should induce cycling. The helminth Trichostrongylus retortaeformis in the UK's only native lagomorph, the mountain hare, has exactly these properties, and the hares exhibit strong population fluctuations. Here we use a host-parasite model parametrized using the available empirical data to test this superficial concordance between theory and observation. In fact, through an innovative combination of sensitivity and stability analyses, we show that hare population cycles do not seem to be driven by the parasite. Potential limitations in our parametrization and model formulation, together with the possible secondary roles for parasites in determining hare demography, are discussed. Improving our knowledge of leveret biology and the quantification of harvesting emerge as future research priorities. With the growing concern over the present management of mountain hares for disease control in Scotland, understanding their population drivers is an important prerequisite for the effective management of this species.},

abstract = {Aerial line transect methods have been successfully used to count animals in open country; we describe their application for assessing red deer (Cervus elaphus) numbers in Scotland. The results of a pilot study in the north of Scotland are compared to a census count carried out in the same area in the previous year. The aerial line transect method gave an estimate of 2240 red deer in May 1995. This agreed well with the census count giving 2270 in April 1994. The line transect estimate had a coefficient of variation of 25%, whereas no measure of precision is available for the census count. Separate estimates for the number of stags and the number of hinds and calves were obtained with both methods. We suggest improvements in the practical application of the aerial line transect method to increase precision of the abundance estimates. Aerial line transect surveys require fewer person-days of effort than census counts, and are appreciably more cost effective for assessing deer numbers over a large area. We present three case studies for applying aerial line transect methods in Scotland. The case studies compare the cost and effort for an aerial line transect estimate with those of a conventional ground-based census count in West Sutherland and North Ross (Red Deer Commission's counting blocks). Obtaining an estimate of red deer numbers in North Ross with a coefficient of variation of 10% would take 33% of the time of a census count, require 50% of the people and take about 60% of the resources required for a ground-based census count. A joint estimate for North Ross and West Sutherland would reduce the time demand for the line transect estimate (10% coefficient of variation) to about 18% of that required by a census and the resources to 33%.

journal = {Journal of Applied Ecology},
volume = {28},

pages = {454-466},
abstract = {(1) Field trials to evaluate bait uptake by urban foxes were performed in three areas in Bristol, U.K. Seasonal uptake was investigated by laying and monitoring uptake of bait at 2-month intervals throughout the year in the principal experimental area. A biomarker (iophenoxic acid) was incorporated in one of the summer and one of the winter trials, and subsequently foxes were captured in that area to examine for elevated levels of protein-bound iodine in the blood. Bait uptake at different bait densities per fox was investigated in the other two areas. (2) There was a steady increase in the proportion of baits investigated and taken from January/February to September/October, with a slight decrease at the end of the year. There was considerable variation in the proportion of baits taken in different habitat types. Of the foxes sampled, in the summer 35% of adults and 17% of cubs, and in the winter 29% of adults and 23% of sub-adults, were positive for the biomarker. When the number of baits avialable per fox was doubled, the rate of bait uptake per fox increased in the same proportion. (3) The results obtained were compared with bait uptake from rural foxes in Europe and North America. Bait uptake in Bristol was generally lower than in other studies, as was the proportion of biomarked individuals. The differences in bait uptake in Bristol, throughout the season and at different bait densities per fox, are discussed in relation to fox foraging behaviour and ecology. Mathematical models predict that at least 75% control levels are necessary to prevent rabies outbreaks from spreading, with even higher levels of control needed in some urban areas, and the results presented here show that a control strategy based on a baiting campaign using the protocol currently favoured in Britain is unlikely to reach a large enough proportion of the fox population to control a rabies outbreak.},

pages = {449-468},
abstract = {The colonizing ability, catholic habitat utilization and wide distribution of house mice (Mus domesticus, Rutty) are indicators of their ecological resilience. Numerous studies have been made of commensal, caged and free-living mouse populations though few have assessed the relative importance of physiological and genetical components of adaptability in a simple ecosystem. This paper reports such findings, derived from live-trapping which formed part of an inter-disciplinary study of adaptability in a feral population of house mice living on a small Scottish island (57 ha). The population size ranged from 450-3250 animals. A high proportion of mice showed home-range tenacity, though 15-20% shifted their range during winter. This 'churning' of the population is consistent with the island population forming an effectively panmictic unit rather than fragmented demes. The breeding season, survival of individuals and change in population size related to patterns of gross climatic variation (temperature and rainfall) so that rates of reproduction and survival were lowest in cold, wet conditions. Thermo regulatory adjustment of the mice to lowered ambient temperatures and its contribution to overwinter survival are discussed. Genetical monomorphism of May Island mice is discussed in relation to their biological performance compared with other populations, especially that of the ecologically comparable Skokholm Island (Wales)},

abstract = {Within a conifer plantation, hazel dormice (Muscardinus avellanarius) were individually marked from 2000 to 2016. In four adjacent experimental study areas (ESAs) of 3 ha each, a different method of restoration of a Planted Ancient Woodland Site (PAWS) was carried out in autumn 2003 to remove ca. 33 % of conifers. A third of those left were removed in 2009 and in 2015. The effects on dormouse abundance indices were recorded by routine monitoring of nest boxes, including marking individuals. The overall number of dormouse captures varied from year to year, increasing the year following forestry operations in 2003 and 2009, possibly because nest boxes temporarily became more attractive. The numbers of individually marked adults showed a stable trend but less variation. The numbers of small juveniles recorded appears to be rising in recent years, suggesting a positive impact during the later stages of this conifer forest reversion. The overwinter survival index of marked juveniles fell significantly for those born the year after each forest operation but not those alive when the felling took place. Adult survival did not fall in either year. Initially, dormouse populations were sustained in each ESA after management and the numbers were not significantly different between the treatments. After the 2009 operation dormouse numbers fell significantly in the traditional mechanical area-wide forest thinning treatment and low abundance has continued. This study demonstrating maintenance of a population of a European Protected Species has important implications for managers and we suggest similar forest management considerations are incorporated into policy and best practice guidelines. The results so far suggest that a patchwork regime type of conifer removal regime can be chosen to be both pragmatic for an economic forestry business and ensuring dormice remain in the local forest.},

The distances and direction from the known nest boxes used were very variable. Some individual hibernacula were also successfully excavated to provide further information.

abstract = {Evidence from the only woodland study in the U.K. of the non-native edible dormouse shows (using nest boxes inspected monthly), that whilst some or much breeding occurs in most years, non-breeding years also occur. This is understood to relate to the number of tree species flowering in spring and the amount of flower production. Morris & Morris (2010) used a small sample to show that some adult animals do not appear in the nest box inspection records during the non-breeding years, but are present during the next breeding year. We have subsequently refined and increased the database, collating information on a sample of 222 glis (136 female, 86 male) known to be alive for between 5 and 13 years during a continuous study period of 18 years. The number of old animals (living to at least five years) recorded in nest boxes is significantly different between years of breeding and non-breeding with up to 90 % absent. There is no evidence that they move elsewhere in the isolated wood. Both males and females displayed this trait. The paper discusses alternative explanatory options interpreted from this. The applied science impact is that if 18 month hibernation is proven the time and cost implications for population control planning are severe. Future research is aimed at demonstrating the reality.},

abstract = {The common dormouse is a European protected species that is considered at risk during forest management operations in the UK. Historically, they were believed to exist principally in scrub and broadleaved woodlands, especially hazel coppice, but recent evidence has shown that they are present in some conifer sites at low density. Operations to restore conifer plantations on ancient woodland sites (PAWS) with native broadleaves may be especially hazardous to dormice populations, since dormouse densities are generally lower here so sudden perturbations may cause local extinction. Recent policy for restoring PAWS to broadleaved and the need to comply with European legislation has emphasised the need to devise appropriate but pragmatic forest management protocols involving the phased removal of conifers over time. Dormice were handled and individually marked on a single 12 ha conifer PAWS site from 2000 and a density index calculated from 2002 to 2007. In four adjacent study areas, a different form of PAWS restoration was carried out in 2003 to remove c. 33% of conifers. The effects on dormouse numbers, damage to artificial hibernation nests, and regeneration of suitable habitat were recorded. Monitoring indicated that dormouse populations were sustained in each study area after management, suggesting that at this site, conifer removal operations did not have a significant detrimental effect on the dormouse population. Damage to artificial hibernation nests was significantly different between the four study areas. The least damage occurred in the study area containing large group fells due to potential refuge areas, and worst in the traditional standard overall thinning. Measured differences in shrub vegetation throughout each study area showed that numerous small group fells or a few larger group fells subsequently regenerated to form a better vegetation structure for dormice than the traditional standard overall thinning. The implications for forest managers of the results from this single site are discussed.},

Data on physical and biological factors from 450 sites were collected to seek explanations for this variation. The rabbit abundance index on the 2.25 km transects (walked along the edge of fields, woods, hedges, etc.) was used as the dependent variable for multiple regression and principal components analyses. Additionally, a preliminary attempt at mapping rabbit abundance and distribution in England and Wales using a GIS system was made. Each of the analyses produced a list of the important variables enhancing or reducing rabbit indices. Common to each list were aspects of woodland - area, number of pieces and length of edge; the dryness and patchiness of soils on site; rainfall in late winter, or variables associated with wetness of soil (e.g. number of days with rain, altitude). Other important variables included predator removal policy and the site location nationally. The two strongest components, woodland parameters and predator removal policy, are under human influence. The effects of region, county and year were small, but year-to-year variation within sites was larger, suggesting that rabbit populations were reacting markedly to unmeasured variables, e.g. myxomatosis outbreaks. The analysis provides a useful explanation of the factors that affect rabbit populations and a basis for how these factors may be manipulated.},

abstract = {Predation has usually been interpreted as being a compensatory mortality factor, removing only the doomed surplus. The literature on the wild Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus L. is reviewed to collate counter‐evidence for a regulating influence of predation. This evidence is almost entirely circumstantial, not experimental. Predation has been reported to extend the length of time Rabbit populations remain low following a significant reduction of Rabbits by some other agent. Rabbit populations have been shown to increase very rapidly when predator density has suddenly been reduced. It has been suggested that predators affect the spread and dispersion of Rabbits both at the geographical and local levels. Predation has not, however, been shown to have an important influence at high Rabbit densities. Thus, its role can be that of a limiting factor rather than a density‐dependent regulatory mortality factor.

The concept of predator pressure is presented and discussed, pointing out that there is currently no standard technique used for its measurement.

Further evidence on the importance of predation is presented from four recent studies in England and Wales that relate, by association, the distribution and abundance of local Rabbit populations to the local attitude towards predators. Rabbits were found to be significantly more widespread and abundant where predators were removed (not restricted to keepered game estates) or at low density, than when predators were undisturbed or at a high density. The significance of these results is discussed.

The circumstantial and corroborative evidence leads strongly to the conclusion that predator pressure can act as an additive rather than compensatory mortality factor in some circumstances, and can thus be a potential regulating factor. Predation is more likely to be a limiting factor at low Rabbit density however, since a density‐dependent relationship has not been demonstrated throughout the range of Rabbit densities that occur. This requires experimental demonstration to determine the threshold pressure below which predation becomes limiting. If so, reductions in Rabbit populations by short‐term control operations could allow natural predation to help maintain low Rabbit densities for several years in some habitats. Conversely, the implications for Rabbit populations and thus crop damage resulting from predator control (e.g. in game management regimes) should be appreciated.},

abstract = {1. Conservation issues and a potential role in disease transmission generate the continued need to census Eurasian badgers Meles metes, but direct counts and sett counts present difficulties. The feasibility of estimating social group size and population density of badgers by quantifying their use of latrines was evaluated. 2. The number of latrines, or preferably the number of separate dung pits, which were known from bait-marking to be used by members of a social group, was positively correlated with adult group size estimated from mark-recapture studies at Woodchester Park and North Nibley (south-west England). In the latter study area both latrine-use measures were also significantly associated with total group size (i.e. including cubs and adults). 3. In spring 1997 and 1998, we quantified latrine use along strip transects, following linear features across four and five areas, respectively, in England, where badger density in summer was known from mark-recapture/resight studies. 4. Seven latrine-use measures were evaluated with regard to their potential to predict badger density. Each measure separately explained between 62% and 91% of the variation in population density in a given year. The simplest measures (latrines km(-1) and pits km(-1)) were most stable between years. 5. For these two simple latrine-use measures, a linear model without an intercept term explained the highest proportion of variation in population density. A stepwise procedure to produce the best model selected only one (latrines km(-1)) of the two measures as an explanatory variable., indicating that pits km(-1) is colinear with the former variable. 6. A badger census technique based on simple measurements of latrine use has great promise but needs to be validated across a wider range of badger populations, habitats, years, seasons and weather conditions.},

journal = {Biodiversity and Conservation},
volume = {7},

abstract = {Sterilization has rarely been considered as an alternative to culling or vaccination to control wildlife diseases. Disease control by sterilization, as by culling, has most promise when the host's ability for compensatory growth following the removal of density-dependent inhibitions is limited, and when moderate reductions in population density cause disproportionately large reductions in disease prevalence, or even eliminate the disease. For many host/disease examples this will not be the case and vaccination may have overwhelming advantages or may be the only practical option. The impact of sterilization on host density and disease prevalence will develop relatively slowly because sterilization can prevent the recruitment of only one age-cohort at a time. Moreover, unless there is vertical transmission, this age-cohort will consist only of susceptibles. Culling, on the contrary, removes infected as well as susceptible animals. However, for certain disease/host examples, the relative effectiveness of the different control strategies may be altered considerably if their variable effects on the probability of disease transmission are taken into account. Social perturbation or stress could render certain culling strategies ineffective or even counter-productive. Depending on how disease dynamics are influenced by the host's age-structure and reproductive investment; fertility control could offer epidemiological advantages that have been ignored by most disease/host models. We illustrate some of these principles by investigating the theoretical and practical feasibility of an hypothetical sterilization campaign to control bovine tuberculosis in badgers (and hence cattle) in Britain.},

abstract = {1. Many ecological studies on the European badger Meles meles, as well as certain programmes to control bovine tuberculosis, would benefit from a greater understanding of the factors that influence the probability of capturing this animal in cage-traps. We therefore investigated some of the factors that could explain differences in trappability between three badger populations in England: the high-density protected populations of Wytham Woods and Woodchester Park, and the low-density culled population of North Nibley. 2. Trappability (the percentage of all individuals known alive that were actually captured) did not differ between sexes or adult age classes, but significant differences were found between cubs and adults, study areas, seasons and years, and various interactions between these variables. 3. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the culling of badgers in North Nibley may have resulted in a decrease of adult trappability in the following year. 4. Adult badgers at Wytham Woods and Woodchester Park were significantly more likely to be trapped zero times ('trap-shy') or all three times ('trap-happy') in 1996 than predicted by the estimated capture probabilities under the assumption of equal trappability. 5. Wytham Woods differed from the other study areas in that trappability of its badgers was positively related to their body weight and its adult badgers were more likely to be trapped than cubs. These differences could be a consequence of differences in trapping procedures that were followed at Wytham (no prebaiting and fewer traps per badger). 6. Trappability of badgers was not associated with social group size. Although it is difficult to determine precisely the movement and tuberculosis status of badgers based on mark-recapture data, our analyses did not suggest that either variable affected the likelihood of being trapped. 7. Studies that compare demographic, biometric and epidemiological parameters based on data collected from badgers captured at different times or places ought to account for the observed differences in trappability.},

abstract = {The relationships between radio-collaring/tracking and 12 biometric parameters in a population of badgers (Meles meles) that were live-trapped in south-west England were investigated. The length of time for which a badger had worn a radio-collar was selected as an explanatory variable in generalized linear models of three biometric parameters (body condition, body weight and testes volume) irrespective of whether or not age class was included as a variable in the analyses. There was evidence that badgers that had been carrying a radio-collar for 1-100 days had lower body condition scores both when compared to badgers that had not been collared and with those that had been collared for longer than 100 days, suggesting a post-collaring acclimation period. In addition, the time period between first and last capture was longer for radio-collared than non-collared badgers. It is unlikely that this was due to an effect of collaring on trappability or to non-random selection of badgers for collaring. Although testes size differed between non-collared badgers and badgers that had been tagged for > 100 days, the relationship between radio-collaring and reproductive output remained unproven. These results highlight not only the need to assess the welfare aspects of radio-collaring but also the potential intricacy of corollaries of collaring. Explorations such as that reported here are important to the validity of studies that make use of radio-telemetry.},

Capture-mark-recapture data were used to describe the process of recovery from a typical badger removal operation (BRO) at North Nibley, Gloucestershire, UK, which was carried out as part of the government's strategy to control bovine tuberculosis. Data on biometrics, demographics and movement from this low-density disturbed population were compared with those of two nearby high-density undisturbed populations (Wytham Woods and Woodchester Park, UK) in order to study fundamental principles of population dynamics and density-dependence. 2. Badgers moved more between social groups at North Nibley than in the other study areas, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the removal operation. 3. Recolonization of the vacated habitat occurred in the first instance by young females. 4. Although in the first year after the BRO no cubs had been reared in any of the culled groups, and although the shortage of sexually mature boars may have limited the reproductive output of sows in the following year, the population took only 3 years to recover to its (already lowered) preremoval density. 5. Losses from the adult (and cub) population due to mortality or emigration were smaller at North Nibley than at the other sites. 6. There was much evidence that during 1995 and 1996 density-dependent effects constrained the reproductive output of the high-density populations, and some support for the hypothesis that badgers exhibit the non-linear 'large mammal' type of functional response to density. 7. Badgers at North Nibley were younger, heavier and in better condition than badgers at Wytham Woods and Woodchester Park. 8. We argue that the disease dynamics are likely to be different in disturbed compared with undisturbed badger populations, and that this could affect the effectiveness of BROs.},

The proposed closed-subpopulation model provides a flexible framework to increase the amount of data used for estimation of demographic parameters, by taking into account characteristics of the population and using ancillary non-trapping data. This model defines a subsection of the population that is known to be alive and within the study area during a certain period, regardless of which animals were actually caught. Population size is estimated from the proportion of animals in this closed subpopulation that were actually captured. We used this model to estimate size of a partly culled population of Eurasian badgers (Meles meles). Number of badgers included in the closed subpopulation was maximized by using data from trapping, road-traffic accidents, and radiotelemetry, and by assuming that no additions occurred to the population of young between trapping occasions. Probabilities of capture varied by season and age-class but not sex, trapping, or radio-tagging. Population estimates appeared reliable because estimated number of times individual badgers were trapped in a year corresponded with observed frequencies and estimated size of the young and adult populations corresponded favorably with estimates based on a mark-resight procedure.},

abstract = {The invasion of Great Britain by the gray squirrel from America has posed many interesting problems in ecology and conservation (interactions with the native red squirrel) and in forest management (the gray squirrel severely damages young stands of deciduous trees). Since 1973, mapped data on the annual distribution of the two species in state-managed forests have been published by the Forestry Commission. Using the established methodology of annual ornithological index numbers, series of index numbers have been calculated to show the distributional dynamics of the two species. In Great Britain as a whole there has been rather limited change over the 15-year period from 1973. However, this masks (1) the dramatic distributional decline in the red squirrel in Wales balanced by a modest expansion in Scotland, and (2) the substantial distributional increase in the gray squirrel in the small number of grid squares in Scotland in comparison with the relatively steady distribution in the large number of grid squares in England. A new index, measuring the annual replacement of one species by the other species, indicates little overall change in England and Scotland, but a net advance of the gray squirrel in Wales. A series of Markovian matrices predicted that the red squirrel would persist in forests in Scotland and in some areas of England, but would be rare in Wales. Over Great Britain as a whole, the gray squirrel is likely to occur in about twice as many forest areas as the red squirrel.},

abstract = {Large populations of sika deer occur in lowland heath, woodland, and grassland mosaics in southern England. Previous studies have focused on understanding single factors potentially affecting distribution and habitat selection of sika deer rather than considering simultaneously effects of landscape configuration and human disturbance on their distribution and habitat selection. This study measured effects of habitat availability, landscape structure, and human disturbance on where sika deer placed their home ranges and habitat selection within those ranges. Two main hypotheses were tested: (1) habitat selection differs according to landscape structure and habitat availability at both landscape and home range scales and (2) distribution of sources of human disturbance within the home range of deer affects their distribution. Results from radiotracking 31 females provided support for the first hypothesis and partial support for the second. Habitat selection at the landscape and home range scales differed between landscapes with different habitat structure and availability and was driven by distribution and availability of food and cover and a perceived risk linked to disturbance. Furthermore, deer selected open areas close to cover and this selection was stronger with presence of human disturbance, although results differed between study areas with different habitat distribution and level of disturbance. The study highlights the importance for managing deer of a balance between grazing and cover resources and the distribution of human disturbance.},

abstract = {In many developed countries forest cover is growing and the provision of non-market benefits is increasingly important for forestry management. The benefits provided by a new woodland not only depend on the design of the woodland (local site level), but also on its location in the wider landscape. This paper develops a generic GIS-based method to map the potential biodiversity benefits of new woodlands through an integration of species-habitat modelling for a list of 15 key species derived from a "Local Biodiversity Action Plan", encompassing the Northeast of Scotland, and spatial multi-criteria analysis. For each selected species 'Preferred Future Woodland' maps are produced, indicating the extent to which populations of these species are expected to expand or contract in response to further afforestation. Species are then weighted on the basis of criteria of relative scarcity of suitable habitat and national importance of the regional population. The maps are then combined using this weighting to yield an overall potential biodiversity benefit map, which shows that the areas with the highest potential biodiversity gains are the edges of major agricultural areas (mostly deciduous), the riparian zones (deciduous) and areas adjacent to mature native pine woods (coniferous). It is demonstrated that the use of this map for more explicit spatial targeting of an existing farm afforestation scheme can help to provide much more 'biodiversity value' for taxpayers' money.

Rivers and lakes supported high levels of activity of these species. Bats classified as 45 kHz and 55 kHz phonic types of Pipistrellus pipistrellus had different habitat requirements; 45 kHz P. pipistrellus fed in many habitats, while 55 kHz P. pipistrellus fed mainly over rivers and lakes.

abstract = {1. Numbers of European hares Lepus europaeus have declined throughout Europe as a result of agricultural intensification. Ecological research to inform agricultural management policy is needed. We aimed to identify agricultural land management practices that may benefit this species, which is of conservation concern and of value as a game animal. 2. A postal survey of farmers was used to investigate relationships between the abundance of hares on farmland and current land management, the abundance of a possible competitor (rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus) and the abundance of two predators (buzzard Buteo buteo and fox Vulpes vulpes). 3. Questionnaires were sent to 3000 farms in England and Wales selected from the annual agricultural census database held by the UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the National Assembly for Wales. One-thousand and fifty farmers (35%) responded. Non-respondents were statistically similar to respondents, so the questionnaire data were considered representative of the opinions of farmers in England and Wales. 4. Hares were relatively common on arable farms, especially on those with wheat Triticum aestivum , beet Beta vulgaris or fallow land. They were less common on pastural farms, where the likelihood of seeing hares was increased if improved grass, woodland or, in some cases, arable land was present. The association of relatively frequent sightings of hares with arable land was consistent at four spatial scales (farm, parish group, county and region). 5. Hares were seen rarely where foxes were seen frequently. Hares were generally only hunted on farms where they were common. Hence, records of numbers of hares shot may be used as indices of hare abundance but only in areas where hares are common. 6. Forty-two per cent of farmers believed that hares were declining. Hare numbers were most likely to be increasing on arable farms. 7. Synthesis and applications. Changes in land management that provide year-round cover and forage may make farms more attractive to hares. To benefit hares, pastural farms should have some woodland, improved grass and arable crops; arable farms should have wheat, beet and fallow land.},

abstract = {Differences in diet can explain resource partitioning in apparently similar, sympatric species. Here, we analyzed 1,252 fecal droppings from five species (Eptesicus nilssonii, Myotis brandtii, M. daubentonii, M. mystacinus, and Plecotus auritus) to reveal their dietary niches using fecal DNA metabarcoding. We identified nearly 550 prey species in 13 arthropod orders. Two main orders (Diptera and Lepidoptera) formed the majority of the diet for all species, constituting roughly 80%-90% of the diet. All five species had different dietary assemblages. We also found significant differences in the size of prey species between the bat species. Our results on diet composition remain mostly unchanged when using either read counts as a proxy for quantitative diet or presence-absence data, indicating a strong biological pattern. We conclude that although bats share major components in their ecology (nocturnal life style, insectivory, and echolocation), species differ in feeding behavior, suggesting bats may have distinctive evolutionary strategies. Diet analysis helps illuminate life history traits of various species, adding to sparse ecological knowledge, which can be utilized in conservation planning.},

abstract = {Human and livestock diseases can be difficult to control where infection persists in wildlife populations. Control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in British cattle is complicated by the maintenance of Mycobacterium bovis (the causative agent of bTB) in badgers, acting as reservoirs of infection. Although over 20 000 badgers were culled to control bTB between 1975 and 1997, the incidence of bTB in cattle has substantially increased in parts of Great Britain in recent decades. Our case-control study, involving 1208 cattle herds, provides further evidence of the detrimental effect of localized reactive badger culling in response to the disclosure of a confirmed bTB herd breakdown in cattle. The presence of any reactive badger culling activity and increased numbers of badgers culled in the vicinity of a herd were associated with significantly increased bTB risk, even after adjusting for other important local risk factors. Such findings may partly explain why some earlier localized approaches to bTB control were ineffective.},

pages = {348-360},
abstract = {1. The culling of European badgers Meles meles has been a central part of attempts to control bovine tuberculosis (TB) in British cattle for many years. Recent results, however, indicate that this approach could in practice enhance disease spread. 2. This paper looks at the relationship between TB incidence and badger ecology in a high-density population in south-west England, which has been the subject of a long-term intensive study. The principal aims were to relate the probability of TB incidence, as detected by culture of clinical samples (i.e. excretion of bacilli), at the level of the individual and of the social group to demographic processes, movement, social organization and disease dynamics. 3. The probability of an individual being an incident case was greater in groups where TB was already present, although this was less influential in groups that were subject to some instability in numbers. Both individuals and groups were more likely to be incident cases where the social group was diminishing in size, although no relationship was observed with group size itself. This suggests that the process of group size reduction rather than group size per se has most influence on disease dynamics. The likelihood that either an individual or a group was an incident case was positively correlated with both individual and group-level movement. When the proportion of females in a social group was high, the positive association between movement and incidence was found to be more pronounced and there was a significantly higher probability of incident cases among males. 4. These relationships highlight the importance of social structure in driving TB transmission dynamics in this stable, high-density badger population. The results support the idea that a stable social structure mitigates against new incident cases of disease, and are consistent with the contention that badger culling may create the social circumstances for enhanced transmission of TB.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the effects of red deer Cervus elaphus grazing on a range of plant communities is important for formulating guidelines for the management of forestry plantations, nature reserves and deer hunting enterprises. 2. The effects of red deer on the species composition of plant communities varying in productivity were examined on the Isle of Rum, Inner Hebrides, north-west Scotland. 3. The study compared vegetation inside and outside fences erected to exclude deer for more than 20 years, and between areas of the island where different deer culling policies were instigated in 1991. 4. The effect of the exclusion of deer was directly proportional to vegetation type. Long-term deer exclusion (20-40 years) had negligible effects on the species composition of the most unproductive plant communities, but caused a marked decline in the species richness of productive grassland. The decline was due to the loss of prostrate herb species inside exclosures where Festuca rubra had assumed a high dominance. 5. Changes in the size and sex ratio of the deer populations were not associated with major changes in plant species richness or relative abundance. The most notable change occurred in productive grassland. Here, Festuca rubra had greater cover and several low-growing herbs such as Polygala serpyllifolia and Thymus polytrichus had lower cover in areas where hind numbers had been reduced than in areas where there was no culling. 6. High deer densities within an unculled food-limited population were associated with negligible effects on plants in Molinia caerulea flush and Calluna-Molinia wet heath vegetation. 7. Tree regeneration inside the exclosures or in areas where deer were culled was minor; only two solitary rowan Sorbus aucuparia saplings were found. 8. Flowerhead densities of herbaceous plant species and grasses showed trends that could be associated with cattle grazing. It is suggested that this may lead to changed recruitment, although seed sowing experiments are required to test this. 9. The results suggest that red deer grazing sustains the plant species diversity of productive grasslands, with reduced deer grazing leading to the loss of plant species in these communities. In contrast, the effects of reduced deer densities and altered culling policies on unproductive vegetation types are negligible.},

abstract = {The first European case of bat rabies was reported in 1954. Since then, more than 800 cases have been confirmed from 13 countries. The causative agents are European Bat Lyssavirus Type-1(EBLV-1) and Type-2 (EBLV-2). The natural host of EBLV-1 seems to be the serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) with more than 95% of all cases reported in this species. Although much fewer EBLV-2 cases have been identified, it seems that Myotis dasycneme and M daubentonii are likely to be the principal hosts' species for this virus. The ecological mechanisms underlying the transmission of EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 are still poorly understood. In order to assess the public health risks associated with EBLVs and the implications for bat conservation, some issues need urgent clarification. In this review some of the most pressing topics will be addressed. Only collaboration between a range of disciplines that include virologists, epidemiologists and bat conservationists will be able to elucidate some of these unanswered questions.},

abstract = {Reliable estimates of deer abundance support effective management of source-sink population dynamics in complex landscapes and improve understanding of the relation between deer density and biodiversity impacts. Performance of distance sampling using thermal imaging of Reeves' muntjac Muntiacus reevesi and roe deer Capreolus capreolus was examined across 123 km(2) of conifer forest in Eastern England, sampling 1567 km in total. For muntjac distance sampling was compared to estimates from drive counts in 2007. For each of three subsequent winters (2008-2010), we compared the magnitude and precision of forest-wide abundance estimated from analytical designs that: (i) ignored potential habitat-specific detectability, either with uneven or balanced sampling effort; (ii) controlled for sampling effort and/or density among seven forest blocks (mean = 18.8 km(2) +/- 11.1 SD); (iii) accounted for potential movement prior detection; (iv) accounted for varying detectability among habitat classes (as a covariate), while controlling for differing densities among blocks. Detectability was further examined in models that stratified to estimate habitat-specific Effective Strip Width (ESW). Estimated muntjac densities from distance sampling were of similar magnitude to estimates from drive counts. Over 2008-2010, we observed 1926 muntjac and 921 roe groups; allowing robust abundance estimation and habitat-specific analysis. ESWs in open habitat were 31% and 27% greater than in mature and 45% and 46% greater than in dense habitat, for roe and muntjac respectively. Although differences in densities among model designs were not large, ignoring block or habitat effects gave higher estimates, while models that accounted for habitat-specific detectability gave lower (-8%) and more precise (38% reduction in CV) estimates (n = 3, muntjac: 5.3-7.5% CV; roe deer: 8.8-12.6% CV). The similarity of density estimates between ungrouped and grouped data and analysis of behaviour of detected deer support the conclusion that distance estimates were not biased by avoidance. We conclude that distance sampling using thermal imaging is a robust and powerful method for estimating deer density. In heterogeneous forest density estimates will be improved by accounting for varying detectability among growth stages or habitats.},

abstract = {Hyper-herbivory following predator removal is a global issue. Across North America and Europe, increasing deer numbers are affecting biodiversity and human epidemiology, but effectiveness of deer management in heterogeneous landscapes remains poorly understood. In forest habitats in Europe, deer numbers are rarely assessed and management is mainly based on impacts. Even where managed areas achieve stable or improving impact levels, the extent to which they act as sinks or persist as sources exporting deer to the wider landscape remains unknown. We present a framework to quantify effectiveness of deer management at the landscape scale. Applied across 234km2 of Eastern England, we assessed management of invasive Reeve's muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and native roe (Capreolus capreolus), measuring deer density (using thermal imaging distance transects 780km/year), fertility, neonatal survival, and culling to quantify source-sink dynamics over 20082010. Despite management that removed 2340% of the annual population, 1,287 (95% CI: 2892,680) muntjac and 585 (4541,533) roe deer dispersed annually into the wider landscape, consistent with their ongoing range expansion. For roe deer, culled individuals comprised fewer young deer than predicted by a Leslie matrix model assuming a closed population, consistent with age-dependent emigration. In this landscape, for roe and muntjac, an annual cull of at least 60% and 53%, respectively, is required to offset annual production. Failure to quantify deer numbers and productivity has allowed high density populations to persist as regional sources contributing to range expansion, despite deliberative management programs, and without recognition by managers who considered numbers and impacts to be stable. Reversing an unfavorable condition of woodland biodiversity requires appropriate culls across large contiguous areas, supported by knowledge of deer numbers and fertility.

Overall, median renal metal concentrations were similar to those in bats from mainland Europe and 6- to 10-fold below those associated with clinical effect, although 5% of pipistrelles had kidney Pb residues diagnostic of acute lead poisoning.

abstract = {Global increases in road networks have been matched by traffic flows and are implicated in declines of many sensitive species. Impacts on wildlife by linear development features such as roads include mortality due to vehicle collisions and secondary effects such as preventing traditional movements or severing links between populations. European legislation requires development activities to have 'no detriment' to the favourable conservation status of European protected species (EPS), including great crested newts (Triturus cristatus), hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats (Chiroptera). To protect these and other species, various mitigation measures are available. Within this review, we sought to identify best practice guidance for preventing and mitigating these impacts for EPS in Great Britain, evaluate the evidence underpinning these best practices and identity knowledge gaps that may impede progress in improving practices. Many current practices appear to be implemented at considerable cost despite limited evidence of their effectiveness. This is probably partly due to inadequate definition of effectiveness, which has most frequently been assessed as a reduction in absolute road mortality or increased frequency of safe road crossings. However, challenges in measuring benefits more appropriately, at spatial and temporal scales that are appropriate for population maintenance, may also have contributed. Evidence of the cost-effectiveness of mitigation works could underpin justification for the substantial investment required to implement many of the mitigation methods reviewed, could avoid the potentially wasteful use of ineffective methods and could better safeguard the conservation status of impacted EPS at local and national scales.},

abstract = {Control of livestock diseases can become complicated when wild animals are involved. The Eurasian badger (Meles meles) is considered the principle wildlife host of Mycobacterium bovis (which causes bovine tuberculosis, bTB) in Great Britain and Ireland, but wild deer have also been implicated. Whether wild deer are likely to perpetuate bTB in cattle depends on the exposure risks they pose, the mode of pathogen transmission, the distances over which the disease can be transported and whether they can maintain infection within their own populations independently of other sources. We evaluated the likely host status of each of four species of wild British deer (red, roe, fallow and Reeves' muntjac) and the badger across a range of densities typically observed in Britain by manipulating the reproductive number equation proposed by Anderson and May (1991). We estimate that roe deer almost certainly act as spillover hosts at densities lower than 30 km(-2), red deer below 16 km(-2), muntjac below 6 km(-2), fallow below 4 km(-2) and the badger below 2 km(-2). We also estimate that muntjac will almost certainly act as maintenance hosts at densities above 56 km(-2), fallow above 47 km(-2) and badgers above 24 km(-2). For densities between these values, we cannot be certain of the host status of these species, and for red and roe deer we cannot be certain of host status under most natural conditions typically experienced in parts of Britain experiencing high incidence of bTB in cattle. However, enhanced transmission rates resulting from artificially high densities such as might be experienced at supplementary feeding sites may be sufficient to promote independent maintenance of infection. We were not able to confidently assign host status to any species over a wide range of densities, but conclude that this is likely to reflect reality, where host status may be affected as much by, for example, demographic fluctuations as it is by population density. Our results imply densities below which populations of wild deer inhabiting cattle bTB hotspots ought to be maintained in order to control the possibility of them perpetuating the cycle of intra-and interspecific M. bovis transmission.},

Few deer were observed on the transects, suggesting that they were avoiding tracks and roads at night as opposed to moving in response to the observer. 3. This has implications for data analysis and hence the results of surveys. Left-truncation or grouping of data close to the transect line to cope with road avoidance decreased the precision of the population estimate and may have impacted upon its accuracy. 4.

In enclosure trials, hedgehogs almost exclusively avoided feeding at sites tainted with badger faeces in favour of sites tainted with non-predator faeces, and continued to avoid the previously badger-tainted site after 2 days, but got after 4. Field experiments with free-ranging hedgehogs showed a reduction in foraging effort in response to badger odour over periods of 5 and 30 min, but no evidence of site avoidance over a 24-h period.

The abundance of insects flying just above the water surface was also significantly greater in sections with a smooth water surface with trees on both sides. The distribution of bats thus probably correlated with the higher densities of insects, and may also have been related to the avoidance of noise from rough water areas which interferes with echolocation. The results suggest that in upland river systems, maintenance and enhancement of bankside vegetation and tree cover in association with the maintenance and enhancement of a mosaic of water surfaces (to include some smooth water where trees are present) will increase the value of the riverine habitat to bats.

Analyses of roosts for which data was available in most years failed to find any evidence of changes in number of emerging bats over time either between roosts or across geographical regions.

Power analysis suggested that the present monitoring programme should be able to detect a 5% increase or decrease over a 5-year period and could detect smaller trends over longer periods of time even when some data were missing.

Its diet was studied by faecal analysis, and habitat use was monitored by radio-telemetry and time-expanding bat-detectors. The diet, which varied between the two sites and also with the season, consisted primarily of small Nematoceran Diptera plus smaller numbers of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. Foraging ranges were relatively large - bats flew a mean maximum distance of 4.2 km from the roost. Minimum area convex polygons enclosed an average of 7.4 km(2), but were up to 18.4 km(2). Bats significantly preferred foraging in areas of woodland and along scrub-lined roads in Kent, but over pasture around Bristol. Urban and arable areas were avoided at both sites. Bat-detector transects showed a significant preference for bats to forage along woodland margins.},

abstract = {The echolocation calls used by Nyctalus leisleri during search phase in open air space are between 9 and 14 ms long, with the peak energy between 24 and 28 kHz. The pulses are shallowly frequency-modulated with or without an initial steep frequency-modulated component. The diet consists primarily of small flies (Diptera), including many chironomids (wingspan 9-12 mm) and yellow dung flies (Scatophaga; wingspan 24 mm), but also of some larger insects such as dung beetles (Coleoptera; Scarabaeoidea), caddis-flies (Trichoptera) and moths (Lepidoptera). The echo target strength of some prey items was measured. Contrary to models based on standard targets such as spheres or disks, the echo strength of real insects was found to be virtually independent of the emitted frequency within the 20-100 kHz frequency range. A model was used to calculate probable detection distances of the prey by the bat. Using narrow-band calls of 13.7 +/- 2.7 ms duration, a bat would detect the two smallest size classes of insect at greatest range using calls of 20 kHz. The results may therefore explain why many species of large and medium sized aerial-hawking bats use low-frequency calls and still eat mostly relatively small insects. The data and model challenges the assumption that small prey are unavailable to bats using low-frequency calls.},

pages = {2663-2672},
abstract = {1. Recreational hunting is widespread and can benefit nature conservation when well-practised, monitored, and regulated. Management for recreational red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica shooting on upland heathland in the UK causes conservation conflict because the intensive habitat, predator, and disease management needed to maintain high-grouse densities for "driven" shooting has detrimental environmental impacts, notably for raptor populations. 2. Sustainable management of mountain hares Lepus timidus scoticus, a game species in the same landscapes, poses a challenge. Control of transmission to grouse of a viral disease, louping-ill, for which mountain hares are a host, has become an additional motivation to kill mountain hares since research during 1993-2001 suggested that culls might reduce infection rates in grouse. 3. We analysed population trends of mountain hares from spring counts on moorland managed for grouse shooting and on contiguous alpine land. On moorland sites, a long-term decline (4.6% per annum) from 1954 to 1999 increased to 30.7% per annum from then until 2017, with a density index falling to <1% of initial levels after 2008. Before 1999, declines were associated with conifer planting and were least severe where heather burning characteristic of grouse management was present. Grouse moors had the highest rate of decline after 1999. 4. On alpine sites, the density index increased by 2.0% per annum from 1954 to 2007, then declined by 12.3% per annum but remained within the previous range of variation. 5. Despite lack of evidence that it increases grouse numbers, reduction of louping-ill transmission to grouse became a more frequent justification for mountain hare culls at a time consistent with it causing these recent, rapid mountain hare declines on grouse moors. 6. Synthesis and applications. Long-term field counts suggest that intensification of game bird management has resulted in severe, recent declines in mountain hare numbers, exacerbating longer term declines associated with land-use change. Management practices founded on misinterpretation of earlier research are the probable cause. Regulation of hare culling would provide a framework for formal tests of whether culls affect grouse surpluses. It would also provide an opportunity to examine mountain hare populations' resilience to culls of varying size and seasonal timing.},

pages = {179-194},
abstract = {The diet of otters Lutra lutra living in a sea loch on the Isle of Mull was described by means of spraint analysis. Seasonal and spatial differences in the spraint composition were explored in the context of fluctuations in prey availability, as revealed by trapping. Butterfish Pholis gunnellus and the cottids Myoxocephalus scorpius and Taurulus bubalis were the most commonly occurring prey in spraints. In the winter, the proportion of rocklings (Ciliata spp. and Gaidropsarus spp.) and non-rockling gadoids (Gadidae) in the diet increased. Their relatively large size makes these latter species an important constituent of the winter diet. Seasonal and spatial variation in fish consumption largely reflected fluctuations in availability. The mean size of principal prey fishes in spraints was similar to that observed in the traps. These observations suggest that otters were not strongly selective with regard to fish species and size. Shore crabs, in contrast, were not taken in proportion to availability. The findings are discussed in the light of other studies of the diet of coastal otters. It is suggested that the lack of selectivity demonstrated in this study, compared with previous studies, may be explained by area-related variations in prey availability.},

volume = {105},

pages = {1053-1071},
abstract = {Introduced American grey squirrels have replaced native red squirrels in most of the range currently occupied in Britain and northern Italy. The mechanisms of the replacement are not yet fully understood. We restated the commonly cited Interference Competition Hypothesis (ICH) that grey squirrels interfere with the behaviour of red squirrels in three possible ways: 1. by direct aggressive interactions; 2. by interrupting red squirrel mating-chases; or 3. by forcing red squirrels to actively avoid areas intensively used by grey squirrels. We compared the activity pattern, behaviour and reproductive performance of red squirrels in two study areas in northern Italy, one with only red squirrels (control area C1), the other with both species (experimental area E1). The following predictions were tested: 1. the total time spent in both intraspecific and interspecific interactions by red squirrels increases in the experimental area. 2. most interspecific interactions are aggressive, with grey squirrels being the dominant species; 3. the proportion of breeding female red squirrels that are unsuccessful at weaning offspring increases in area El; 4. grey squirrels take part and interfere with red squirrel mating-chases, and thereby decrease the reproductive output of red squirrel females. 5. the activity pattern of red squirrels in the mixed-species area is shifted with respect to that in the control area to the hours of the day during which grey squirrels show little activity; and 6. red squirrels will shift their home range (or at least their core-area) when grey squirrel densities increase to avoid interspecific core-area overlap. Our results supported only the first prediction of the ICH: they failed to support all the other predictions. Moreover, the increase in the percentage of active time red squirrels spent interacting with other squirrels in the experimental study area was very small (only 1-2 min/day). Red squirrels did not avoid the woodland patches most intensively used by grey squirrels and the interspecific core-area overlap was similar to red squirrel intraspecific core-area overlap. This suggested that red squirrels avoided spatial overlap with grey squirrels in a similar manner as with conspecifics and that an increase in grey squirrel numbers will augment the intensity of resource competition. We therefore conclude that our results do not lend support to the Interference Competition Hypothesis and that interference competition by grey squirrels cannot explain the large-scale replacement of red by grey squirrels that has occurred in Britain and in Piedmont.},

abstract = {Interspecific competition between red squirrels and grey squirrels was investigated by comparing the population demography, spacing behavior and habitat use of red squirrels in two large conifer plantations in northern England: one site had only red squirrels (the 'red-only' site), in the other both red and grey squirrels occurred (the 'red-grey' sire). Despite more abundant food at the red-grey site, red squirrel densities (0.26 ha(-1) at the red-grey site, 0.29 ha(-1) at the red-only site), adult survival rates and the breeding rates of females were similar at both study sites. Grey squirrels at the red-grey site occurred at higher densities (0.92-1.1 ha(-1)) than did the reds and tended to have higher breeding rates. In the presence of grey squirrels, the recruitment pattern of red squirrels changed and there was little recruitment of subadults. The juvenile recruitment rate in the red-grey site (13%) was much lower than in the red-only site (50%). Grey squirrels, in contrast, had higher juvenile recruitment rates at the red-grey site (41%). The core areas of the home ranges of red squirrels in the red-grey site were more strongly overlapped by grey squirrels than by conspecifics. Red squirrels did not select the habitat with the best tree seed crop (Scots pine) but preferred dense Sitka spruce plantations; they appeared to avoid the Scots pine area with its high grey squirrel density. Data on foot length and body condition indicated decreased body growth in young red squirrels when grey squirrels were present. Our data suggest that adult red squirrels suffered little from interspecific competition with grey squirrels and that the key factor is decreased juvenile recruitment in red squirrels.},

abstract = {Factors influencing the growth and mortality patterns of young were examined in a small population of European wild rabbits. Juveniles were trapped and tagged for individual identification soon after their emergence from underground nests. Age was estimated from weight on first capture and survivorship determined from the last date individuals were observed. Differences in growth rates of young born throughout the season and between the three years of the study were related to population density. Maternal social status had no significant effect on post-emergence growth rates of kittens, or on offspring survival. Young born in females' first litters of the season, in March, had significantly lower mortality than subsequent litters. Cats and stoats were regularly observed on the study site and are likely to have been major agents of juvenile mortality. There was no difference in the growth rates of the sexes, and correspondingly non-breeding adult males and females were of similar body weight. From their first days above ground juvenile males suffered significantly higher mortality than females. Differential mortality may be linked to previously reported sex differences in behaviour if the greater activity of young males made them more vulnerable to predation or attack by neighbouring territorial conspecifics.},

The slope of the relationship (food-dependent urine loss) (363 mu l.g dry mass food(-1), S.D. = +/-70, n = 19) was not significantly different between the two species but predicted urine loss at zero food consumption (food-independent urine loss) was significantly lower in P. auritus (0.048 mu l.min(-1), S.D. = +/-0.015, n = 12) than in M. daubentoni (0.217 mu l.min(-1), S.D. = +/-0.040, n = 7). The same results were apparent if the data for M. daubentoni were restricted to water-deprived animals only. Of total urine loss, 46% occurred in the first hour after feeding in M. daubentoni compared with only 20% in P. auritus. We suggest that the differences between the two species in the pattern of postprandial urine loss reflect their relative association with open water when foraging and roosting in the wild. In the course of the water-denied experiment, M. daubentoni lost 15% of pre-fed body mass and showed signs of severe dehydration, while P. auritus only lost 6% and did not. However, urine loss only accounted for 8-10% of body mass loss. A water budget model for wild P. auritus in the summer was developed and suggested that if bats did not drink, approximately 19% of water loss would be attributable to faecal water loss, 18-20% to urine loss, and 59-62% of intake would be available to support evaporation and reproductive losses.},

Using the conflict arising over proposals to cull hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus on several Scottish islands, we show how different stakeholder groups frame the problem in different ways. 3. Stakeholder groups supporting different courses of action (culling vs. translocating hedgehogs) use different arguments, the former emphasizing conservation and biodiversity, the latter focusing on animal welfare. Our method results in a graphical representation of this failure to agree on a common way to frame the issue. 4. Including texts obtained from media sources illustrates how the media can exacerbate environmental conflicts through the issues they emphasize and the vocabulary they use. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our method provides a simple means to quantify levels of stakeholder disagreement concerning potentially contentious environmental issues. Our results provide a starting point for the development of a quantitative, graphical tool for managers, where repeated analysis will aid in monitoring and managing conflicts. In addition, we provide a clear example of the role of societal attitudes influencing the effective implementation of ecological advice, which should encourage ecologists to become more aware of the social environment into which policy recommendations are to be launched and to ensure that their advice does not ignore important stakeholder values.},

abstract = {1. Quantifying animal density is a fundamental requirement for the successful management of canid species. Faecal transects along linear features represent a cost-effective means of quantifying relative density. However, it is unclear whether such counts can be utilized to estimate absolute density. 2. In Britain, due to proposed legislative changes in permitted culling practices, and as part of a wider monitoring programme, the current and future density of red foxes Vulpes vulpes is of applied interest. In this study, we counted fox faeces in 444 1-km squares throughout mainland Britain to construct a baseline index of fox density against which future changes could be measured. By incorporating estimates of the defecation rate and the proportion of scats associated with linear features, we estimated absolute density in seven landscapes. These estimates were compared with existing data on fox density. 3. On average, captive foxes consumed 0.85 kg food day(-1). Defecation rate (8 scats fox(-1) day(-1)) was not affected by the type of food consumed. 4. The proportion of scats associated with linear features was determined by feeding individual free-living foxes a known amount of food containing an indigestible marker. On average, 5.7% of scats were deposited along linear features. 5. Mean fox density in landscapes ranged from 0.21 to 2.23 foxes km(-2). These estimates agreed closely with the limited data available on fox density in Britain. The total rural fox population was estimated to be 225 000 foxes (95% confidence interval 179 000-271 000). Including foxes in urban areas, the total national population is estimated to be approximately 258 000 individuals. 6. Synthesis and applications. The results suggest that faecal density counts have the potential to be used to estimate fox density over large spatial scales, although further work on estimating the proportion of scats associated with linear features and the use of faeces in territorial marking by canids is required.},

Significant preferences for the grass Deschampsia flexuosa were observed in feeding trials and in the wild while the sedge Eriophorum vaginatum was avoided in both. There was no clear preference for Molinia caerulea and Nardus stricta. Preference for plant species was related to palatability and nutrient content. The low nutrient conditions in British uplands mean that voles that live in these environments must be selective feeders to maximise nutrient intake.},

In grazed areas Molinia caerulea grasslands supported most voles, Nardus stricta grasslands supported fewer and Eriophorum vaginatum and Calluna vulgaris-dominated areas supported least. There were highly significant negative relationships between vole sign density and sheep numbers in these habitats. Where sheep were excluded, these same habitats had between three and nine times higher sign densities, corresponding to between 1.5 and 2.5 times greater field vole densities. Population estimates of voles and predators such as short-eared owl approximately doubled under reduced grazing. Reducing sheep numbers in upland areas may therefore be critical in encouraging the recovery of predatory birds in the uplands. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that invading species can gain an advantage over native species by introducing novel disease. A clear understanding of the role of disease in the expansion of introduced and invading species is therefore essential for the conservation of native species. In this study we focus on the case study system of the UK red and grey squirrel system in which disease-mediated competition has facilitated the replacement of red squirrels by greys. We modify a deterministic model of the squirrel system in which the competition and infection dynamics are well understood to produce a stochastic model which includes a realistic representation of the heterogeneous habitat in Southern Scotland. The model is used to examine the potential spread of infection (squirrelpox virus) through the squirrel system and to examine the impact of conservation measures that control grey squirrel numbers in an attempt to contain disease spread. The results have direct implications for conservation management and we discuss how they have helped shape current and future policy for red squirrel conservation in Scotland. The methods in this study can be readily adapted to represent different systems and since the stochastic population and disease dynamics are underpinned by classical deterministic modelling frameworks the results are applicable in general.},

abstract = {Badgers are believed to be responsible for a high proportion of the cases of bovine tuberculosis in cattle in southwest England where, despite the onset of badger control operations in 1975, comparatively high numbers of cattle continue to fail the tuberculin test. To determine why the disease remains a problem in these areas, data on badger densities and patterns of land use were examined. Areas subject to repeated badger control operations had greater landscape heterogeneity and a higher density of linear habitat features. These habitat features were not related to badger density, measured as the mean number of social groups per square kilometre. Environmental contamination by infected badger urine is thought to be the main mode for the transmission of bovine tuberculosis. Field studies in an area with tuberculosis in both badgers and cattle showed that badgers may urinate on pasture after crossing through a linear feature, and that the number of these crossing-point urinations increases with the number of linear features crossed. The hypothesis is presented that these crossing-point urinations are a major source of bovine tuberculosis infection in cattle, and that areas with increased numbers of linear features have greater levels of contamination of pasture with badger urine and hence increased opportunities for disease transmission.},

pages = {693-706},
abstract = {1. Contacts between susceptible and infectious individuals determine how fast a disease will spread. However, they are difficult to measure in the wild, and most models of disease spread have been forced to use estimated or derived values. 2. In this paper, a mathematical relationship between fox home range size and population density is derived from the literature and combined with behavioural data on movement patterns and encounters from urban Bristol, UK to formulate a predictive model of intergroup contact probabilities over a range of population densities. 3. This contact probability-population density relationship is used to formulate a revised version of the rabies model of Smith & Harris (1991), which is the model used by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as the basis of its rabies control policy for an outbreak of the disease in an urban area of Britain. 4. The original and revised versions of the model are compared in terms of their predictions for the rate of rabies spread and their implications for rabies control in specific urban areas. 5. An equivalent probability of successful rabies control is achieved by 5-15% lower fox control for the revised model compared with the original one. The greatest differences between the probability of successful rabies control for a given level of fox control under the two versions of the model occur in winter. 6. The revised model predicts that the rate of rabies spread will be slower than predicted by the original model. This is due to the lower inter-group contact probabilities used in the revised model, Thus, there will be a greater chance of containment and elimination of the disease within a specified control area than was suggested by the original model. 7. The heterogeneous nature of the urban landscape probably results in a lower frequency of contacts than would be observed between foxes living at the same densities in rural environments.},

abstract = {A spatial stochastic simulation model was used to assess the potential of fertility control, based on a yet-to-be-developed oral bait-delivered contraceptive directed at females, for the control of bovine tuberculosis in badger populations in south-west England. The contraceptive had a lifelong effect so that females rendered sterile in any particular year remained so for the rest of their lives. The efficacy of fertility control alone repeated annually for varying periods of time was compared with a single culling operation and integrated control involving an initial single cull followed by annually repeated fertility control. With fertility control alone, in no instance was the disease eradicated completely while a viable badger population (mean group size of at least one individual) was still maintained. Near eradication of the disease (less than 1% prevalence) combined with the survival of a minimum viable badger population was only achieved under a very limited set of conditions, either with high efficiency of control (95%) over a short time period (1-3 years) or a low efficiency of control (20%) over an intermediate time period (10-20 years). Under these conditions, it took more than 20 years for the disease to decline to such low levels. A single cull of 80% efficiency succeeded in near eradication of the disease (below 1% prevalence) after a period of 6-8 years, while still maintaining a viable badger population. Integrated strategies reduced disease prevalence more rapidly and to lower levels than culling alone, although the mean badger group size following the onset of control was smaller. Under certain integrated strategies, principally where a high initial cull (80%) was followed by fertility control over a short (1-3 year) time period, the disease could be completely eradicated while a viable badger population was maintained. However, even under the most favourable conditions of integrated control, it took on average more than 12 years following the onset of control for the disease to disappear completely from the badger population. These results show that whilst fertility control would not be a successful strategy for the control of bovine tuberculosis in badgers if used alone, it could be effective if used with culling as part of an integrated strategy. This type of integrated strategy is likely to be more effective in terms of disease eradication than a strategy employing culling alone. However, the high cost of developing a suitable fertility control agent, combined with the welfare and conservation implications, are significant factors which should be taken into account when considering its possible use as a means of controlling bovine tuberculosis in badger populations in the UK.},

abstract = {Monitoring is essential to evaluate the success of translocations, but is frequently neglected. One exception has been the reinforcement of the otter (Lutra lutra) population in the Derwent and Esk catchments in North East England, UK, between 1990 and 1993. Here, we use data on otter sprainting activity collected before, during and after translocations to identify relationships with vegetation, food resources and physical river characteristics. Sprainting activity increased significantly with trout density, stream order, and surrounding cover by woodland and semi-natural grassland vegetation, and decreased significantly with stream gradient. The form of these relationships was unimodal, sprainting activity peaking at intermediate levels of environmental variables. A logistic regression model including variables relating to fish density, the physical characteristics of the river and surrounding vegetation cover was able to predict the presence or absence of otter sprainting at different survey sites with an accuracy of 92%. Fish density and the physical characteristics of the river were the most important factors in the model. Models such as this are of practical use for assessing the likely success of future otter translocations, both in North East England and other regions of the UK and Europe.

abstract = {Aim Island populations of small mammals are often characterized by a larger body size compared with neighbouring mainland or continental populations of the same species. A number of reasons have been put forward to explain this phenomenon. The aim of this study was to test which of these hypotheses can best explain the increase of body size in common shrews (Sorex araneus) on islands. Location The fieldwork for this study was carried out on the islands of the Inner Hebrides, Clyde Islands and the west coast of Scotland. Methods This study compared body sizes of common shrews from mainland and island sites on the west coast of Scotland, based on measurements of hind foot lengths. On 10 of the 13 islands sampled, common shrews were significantly larger than on the mainland. Body size did not vary significantly among mainland populations. We used the directional contrasts method to test the relative contributions of possible factors explaining the large body size observed in the island populations. Results We found that body size of common shrews on islands was positively related to distance from mainland, negatively related to average annual temperature, negatively related to island size, and may also be influenced by the presence or absence of pygmy shrews (Sorex minutus) on the island. Main conclusions Our results suggest a role for founder events, Bergmann's rule and K-selection in determining body size of common shrews on islands.},

abstract = {Populations of many species are currently being fragmented and reduced by human interactions. These processes will tend to reduce genetic diversity within populations and reduce individual heterozygosities because of genetic drift, inbreeding and reduced migration. Conservation biologists need to know the effect of population size on genetic diversity, as this is likely to influence a population's ability to persist. Island populations represent an ideal natural experiment with which to study this problem. In a study of common shrews (Sorex araneus) on offshore Scottish islands, 497 individuals from 13 islands of different sizes and 6 regions on the mainland were trapped and genotyped at eight microsatellite loci. Previous genetic work had revealed that most of the islands in this study were highly genetically divergent from one another and the mainland. We found that most of the islands exhibited lower genetic diversity than the mainland populations. In the island populations, mean expected heterozygosity, mean observed heterozygosity and mean allelic richness were significantly positively correlated with log island size and log population size, which were estimated using habitat population density data and application of a Geographic Information System.},

journal = {Conservation Biology},
volume = {18},
number = {5},
pages = {1283-1292},
abstract = {Insects are the principal food for many animals, including bats (Chiroptera), and all species of bats in the United Kingdom feed over agricultural habitats. Bat populations are declining throughout Europe, probably in part as a result of agricultural intensification. Organic farming prohibits the use of agrochemicals, a major component of agricultural intensification, making it an ideal control for a study of intensive agricultural systems. To evaluate the impact of agricultural intensification on bat foraging, we quantified the availability of bat prey by comparing nocturnal aerial insects captured within habitats on 24 matched pairs of organic and conventional farms. Insects were identified to family and moths to species. We compared the abundance of 18 insect families commonly eaten by bats in the United Kingdom between farm types and tested for correlations of abundance with bat activity. Insect abundance, species richness, and moth species diversity were significantly higher on organic farms than on conventional farms. Insect abundance was significantly higher in pastural and water habitats on organic farms than in the same habitats on conventional farms. Of the 18 insect families that are important components of the bat diet, 5 were significantly more abundant on organic farms overall. Some were also more abundant within organic pastural, woodland, and water habitats than on conventional farmland habitats. The activity of bats that mainly ate Lepidoptera was significantly correlated with the abundance of this order. Our observations suggest that agricultural intensification has a profound impact on nocturnal insect communities. Because bats are resource limited, a reduction in prey availability through agricultural intensification will adversely affect bat populations. Less-intensive farming benefits British bat populations by providing and maintaining diverse and structurally varied habitats, which in turn support a wide selection of insect prey for bats, including insect families that are significant components of the diet of a number of rare bat species.},

abstract = {1. Agricultural intensification is perceived to be a major cause of the decline in many European bat populations. Because organic farming prohibits the use of agrochemicals, we compared organic vs. conventional farm types to test the hypothesis that agricultural intensification based on high levels of agrochemical use has been a factor in bat population declines. Bat activity and species richness were compared on matched pairs of organic and conventional farms. 2. Bat activity was quantified using acoustic surveys within specific habitats on farms in southern England and Wales. Eighty-nine per cent of bat passes were identified to species level using artificial neural networks (ANN). A further 9% were identified to genus. 3. Total bat activity was significantly higher on organic farms than on conventional farms. Significantly more bat passes were recorded over water on organic farms than on conventional farms. Foraging activity (quantified in two ways: total feedings buzzes and feeding buzzes per pass) was significantly higher on organic farms than on conventional farms. 4. The dominant species on both farm types were Pipistrellus pipistrellus and Pipistrellus pygmaeus. Significantly more passes of Myotis species were recorded on organic farms than on conventional farms. This difference was also significant when water habitats were considered alone. 5. The activity of both Myotis daubentonii and Myotis brandtii was significantly higher on organic farms than on conventional farms. The activity of Myotis bechsteinii and Myotis brandtii was significantly higher over organic water habitats than over conventional water habitats. Rhinolophus hipposideros and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum were only recorded on organic farms in wooded, arable and pasture habitats. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study highlights the position of bats as bioindicators and victims of agricultural change. The differences in bat activity between farm types may reflect features such as taller hedgerows and better water quality on organic farms. Higher foraging activity also suggests that habitat quality in terms of prey availability is greater on organic farms. Less intensive farming benefits bats, and as the number of organic enterprises increases it may help to reverse declines in bat populations.},

journal = {Journal of Applied Ecology},
volume = {41},
number = {3},
pages = {492-501},
abstract = {1. In recent years bovine tuberculosis (TB) incidence in cattle has been increasing in south-west England. The European badger Meles meles is implicated in the transmission of TB to cattle and has been the subject of culling operations in an attempt to control the disease. 2. An individual-based, spatial, stochastic, simulation model was used to investigate the control of TB in the badger by various badger-vaccination strategies. Nearly all population and epidemiological parameters were derived from a single long-term study site. Heterogeneous carrying capacities (the maximum number of breeding females per badger social group) and different sized badger territories were used to simulate natural heterogeneity. The model included the transmission of TB from badgers to cattle to allow reactive vaccination of badgers, i.e. in response to positive cattle TB test results. 3. The model predicted that badger populations with reduced contiguity (e.g. natural barriers) between social group territories would have a lower TB prevalence. 4. In the absence of information on the true prevalence of TB in badger social groups, vaccinating 80% of groups at a low vaccine probability (10% successfully immunized) was more effective in the model at reducing prevalence of TB in badgers, than vaccinating 10% of the groups at a higher probability (80% successfully immunized). 5. Although a lower cost option, vaccinating badgers purely in reaction to cattle herd infections took longer to reduce badger TB prevalence to 50% than proactive strategies (7-20 years compared with 3-5 years). Simulations suggested that at least 40% of healthy badgers need to be immunized each year to eradicate TB in the badger. The model indicated that vaccination of badgers is a viable alternative to badger culling for the control of TB in cattle. Combined control policies were not investigated. 6. Synthesis and applications. Widespread proactive vaccination appears to be the most effective strategy for disease control. Initial proactive vaccination followed by localized reactive vaccination can lead to a greater reduction in disease prevalence for less effort. This is likely to be a global finding for the control of wildlife diseases, although the optimal duration for a proactive campaign will depend upon specific circumstances (e.g. detection rate of disease).},

Current methods used to monitor urban populations are, however, associated with several potential limitations. In this study, we conducted hedgehog footprint-tunnel surveys in 219 residential gardens across Reading, UK between May-September in 2013 and/or 2014; gardens were surveyed for five continuous days. Single-species occupancy models were used to investigate factors influencing hedgehog occupancy and two-species occupancy models were used to estimate a species interaction factor (SIF) between hedgehogs and (a) badgers (Meles meles), (b) foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and (c) dogs (Canis familiaris). The five-day survey protocol was associated with a false-absence error rate of 0.1-0.4%, indicating that it was a reliable method for determining hedgehog presence; conversely, 34.7% of householders were not able to correctly predict hedgehog presence or absence. Hedgehogs were widely distributed across Reading, but detected in only 32-40% of gardens. None of the within-garden or outside-garden factors investigated significantly affected hedgehog occupancy in the single-species models, but the two-species models indicated that badgers (SIF=0.471 +/- 0.188), but not foxes (SIF=0.954 +/- 0.048) or dogs (SIF=0.780 +/- 0.228), negatively affected the presence of hedgehogs in gardens, although not significantly. Overall, footprint-tunnels represent a viable field method for monitoring urban hedgehog populations, however, other approaches are required to identify factors that make gardens hedgehog friendly.},

Relatively little is known about the effects of urbanisation and agriculture on the genetic structure, gene flow and genetic diversity of wild species. Here, landscape genetic techniques were applied to compare local genetic diversity and gene flow between wood mouse populations in urban and arable landscapes. Using nine microsatellite markers, individuals were genotyped from six arable and seven urban sample sites. Inter-population genetic differentiation was significantly greater in urban than arable habitat, while allele richness, private allele richness and heterozygosity were higher for arable sample sites, with varying degrees of significance. These suggest that urban habitat was sufficiently fragmented to limit gene flow. To test the effect of landscape features on gene flow, several cost-distance measures were generated. Overland distance and Euclidean distance correlated best with inter-population genetic differentiation in arable habitat, whereas distances that accommodated differences in habitat quality better explained differentiation in urban habitat. There was no evidence that margins adjacent to roads, rivers or railways facilitated gene flow. Together, the results indicate that urban landscapes expose wood mice to greater fragmentation in habitat quality than arable areas, leading to greater population isolation that is not mitigated by the presence of dispersal corridors.},

abstract = {Small mammal species are abundant and common throughout Europe and often utilise areas that are subject to agricultural land use. Arable farmland is an example of a frequently disturbed habitat, and this study questioned how such disturbance affected the two most common species in the region; one a habitat generalist and one a habitat specialist. We confirmed the prediction that wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus, a habitat generalist) would make use of a variety of habitats and that bank voles (Myodes glareolus, a habitat specialist) would make greater use of the more stable portions of the study site. We surveyed the study site intensively in order to test whether there was continuity in the spatial arrangement of individuals of both species, given the strategy employed. The spatial arrangement of wood mice varied with season but remained stable for bank voles. We found no association, positive or negative, between the spatial distributions of the two species, suggesting that spatial competitive exclusion did not occur. This work provides further insight into how these small mammal species are affected by agricultural disturbance and predictions can be made about how the species will respond under CAP Reform greening practices.},

A recently established feral population of wild boar Sus scrofa in Dorset, southern England, was studied by collecting details of escapes, live sightings and animals killed, by examining field signs and by making direct observations in the field. 2. Records were obtained from 47 national grid kilometre squares. Two or more records were received for 27 km(2) and the presence of boar confirmed by field signs in 21 of these. The population appears to have originated from escapes in winter 1994/95 and to have remained largely confined to within 11 km of the escape site. The large number of animals killed, relative to the number of animals which escaped, reports of shot sows carrying foetuses and observations of sows with piglets in the field, confirmed that breeding had taken place. 3. Estimates of live weight, estimated age, or descriptions of the animals killed were used to allocate each to a broad age class and thus construct a retrospective census. This suggested that the minimum population size peaked at about 30 animals in 1998 but that the prebreeding population has probably remained at fewer than 20 animals.},

Methods based on live-trapping can provide robust estimates of badger numbers, but are very labour-intensive and expensive. The development of alternative methods to predict badger numbers accurately would provide valuable tools for research and management. Badger setts are distinct structures, which exhibit various signs of activity. The physical appearance of setts has been used in the past as a crude guide to the number of badgers likely to be trapped. In this study, an objective system for quantifying levels of activity at badger setts was developed and related to the number of trapped badgers. Several types of activity were positively associated with badger numbers, although these associations varied seasonally. Furthermore, all individual activity scores, summary indices and combinations of activity types were poor predictors of the number of badgers trapped. This is probably because variations in environmental conditions and badger behaviour confound the relationship between activity and badger numbers.},

abstract = {The natural nest sites in hedgerows of the hazel dormouse Muscardinus avellanarius were investigated in Devon, in south-west England. A total of 73 nests were found in the autumn by careful searching of hedgerows, all of which were species-rich. In hedgerows that had not been cut for 6 years or more, most nests were in bramble Rubus fruticosus agg. and field rose Rosa arvensis margins, with a few in holly Ilex aquifolium bushes. In contrast, in hedgerows that had been cut within 6 years, the majority of nests were in shrubs, the dense protective growth at the cut line being strongly favoured. Blackthorn Prunus spinosa was preferentially selected, hazel Corylus avellana was avoided. It is suggested that the availability of safe nest sites may limit population density and that where nesting conditions are good the hazel dormouse may prefer to build nests in unenclosed situations rather than in hollows, whether natural hollows, such as tree holes, or artificial ones, such as nest boxes. To encourage hazel dormice in hedgerows, bramble and rose margins should be allowed to develop, and some lengths of hedgerow should be cut occasionally, particularly where blackthorn is present.},

abstract = {1. The incidence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in British cattle has risen markedly over the last two decades. Failure to control the disease in cattle has been linked to the persistence of a reservoir of infection in European badgers Meles meles, a nationally protected species. Although badger culling has formed a component of British TB control policy for many years, a recent large-scale randomized field experiment found that TB incidence in cattle was no lower in areas subject to localized badger culling than in nearby areas where no experimental culls occurred. Indeed, analyses indicated that cattle incidence was higher in culled areas. 2. One hypothesis advanced to explain this pattern is that localized culling disrupted badgers' territorial behaviour, potentially increasing the rate of contact between cattle and infected badgers. This study evaluated this hypothesis by investigating badger activity and spatial organization in 13 study areas subjected to different levels of culling. Badger home ranges were mapped by feeding colour-marked baits at badger dens and measuring the geographical area in which colour-marked faeces were retrieved. 3. Badger home ranges were consistently larger in culling areas. Moreover, in areas not subjected to culling, home range sizes increased with proximity to the culling area boundary. Patterns of overlap between home ranges were also influenced by culling. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that culling badgers profoundly alters their spatial organization as well as their population density. These changes have the potential to influence contact rates between cattle and badgers, both where culls occur and on adjoining land. These results may help to explain why localized badger culling appears to have failed to control cattle TB, and should be taken into account in determining what role, if any, badger culling should play in future control strategies.},

In particular, while models of disease dynamics usually assume transmission through direct contact, transmission through environmental contamination can cause different dynamics. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) collars and proximity-sensing contact-collars to explore opportunities for transmission of Mycobacterium bovis [causal agent of bovine tuberculosis] between cattle and badgers (Meles meles). Cattle pasture was badgers' most preferred habitat. Nevertheless, although collared cattle spent 2914 collar-nights in the home ranges of contact-collared badgers, and 5380 collar-nights in the home ranges of GPS-collared badgers, we detected no direct contacts between the two species. Simultaneous GPS-tracking revealed that badgers preferred land >50 m from cattle. Very infrequent direct contact indicates that badger-to-cattle and cattle-to-badger M. bovis transmission may typically occur through contamination of the two species' shared environment. This information should help to inform tuberculosis control by guiding both modelling and farm management.},

abstract = {1. Because biological systems are complex, management interventions occasionally have unintended adverse consequences. For example, attempts to control bovine tuberculosis (TB) by culling badgers Meles meles have, under some circumstances, inadvertently increased cattle TB risks. Such harmful effects occur because culling profoundly alters badger movement behaviour, increasing pathogen transmission both between badgers and from badgers to cattle. 2. It has recently been suggested that another TB management tool, badger vaccination with Bacillus Calmette Guerin, might provoke similar behavioural changes and hence similar harmful effects for cattle. We therefore took advantage of an existing project, which monitored 54 GPS-collared badgers across four study sites in southwest Britain, to explore whether vaccination, or live trapping to administer vaccine, influenced badger movement behaviour. 3. We detected no significant effects of either vaccination or trapping on badgers' monthly home range size, nightly distance travelled, or frequency of trespassing in neighbouring territories. The estimated effect of vaccination on badger home range size [2% reduction, 95% confidence interval (CI) 18% reduction - 17% increase] was statistically non-significant, but significantly smaller than that associated with both widespread (180% increase, 95% CI 70-362% increase; P < 0.001) and localised badger culling (74% increase, 95% CI 4-191% increase; P = 0.038). 4. Synthesis and applications. In contrast with culling, live trapping and vaccinating badgers did not measurably alter their movement behaviour, fuelling optimism that vaccination might contribute positively to cattle tuberculosis control. Our study illustrates how existing monitoring can be exploited to assess potentially adverse effects of wildlife management.},

In Britain, farm buildings have been proposed as important sites of Mycobacterium bovis transmission betweenwild badgers (Meles meles) and cattle, contributing to the maintenance of bovine tuberculosis (TB). Farmers are therefore advised to exclude badgers from buildings. We used Global Positioning System (GPS) collars and remote cameras to characterise badgers' use of farm buildings at four TBaffected sites in southwestern Britain. Across 54 GPScollared badgers, 99.8% of locations fell >= 3 m from farm buildings. Remote cameras deployed in feed stores recorded just 12 nights with badger visits among 3134 store nights of monitoring. GPS-collared badgers used space near farm buildings less than expected based on availability, significantly preferring land >= 100 m from buildings. There was no positive association between badgers' use of farm buildings and the infection status of either badgers or cattle. Six GPS-collared badgers which regularly visited farm buildings all tested negative for M. bovis. Overall, test-positive badgers spent less time close to farm buildings than did test-negative animals. Badger visits to farm buildings were more frequent where badger population densities were high. Our findings suggest that, while buildings may offer important opportunities for M. bovis transmission between badgers and cattle, building use by badgers is not a prerequisite for such transmission. Identifying ways to minimise infectious contact between badgers and cattle away from buildings is therefore a management priority.},

abstract = {In most social animals, the prevalence of directly transmitted pathogens increases in larger groups and at higher population densities. Such patterns are predicted by models of Mycobacterium bovis infection in European badgers (Meles meles). We investigated the relationship between badger abundance and M. bovis prevalence, using data on 2696 adult badgers in 10 populations sampled at the start of the Randomized Badger Culling Trial. M. bovis prevalence was consistently higher at low badger densities and in small social groups. M. bovis prevalence was also higher among badgers whose genetic profiles suggested that they had immigrated into their assigned social groups. The association between high M. bovis prevalence and small badger group size appeared not to have been caused by previous small-scale culling in study areas, which had been suspended, on average, 5 years before the start of the current study. The observed pattern of prevalence might occur through badgers in smaller groups interacting more frequently with members of neighbouring groups; detailed behavioural data are needed to test this hypothesis. Likewise, longitudinal data are needed to determine whether the size of infected groups might be suppressed by disease-related mortality. Although M. bovis prevalence was lower at high population densities, the absolute number of infected badgers was higher. However, this does not necessarily mean that the risk of M. bovis transmission to cattle is highest at high badger densities, since transmission risk depends on badger behaviour as well as on badger density.},

abstract = {1. Bovine tuberculosis is a serious disease of cattle caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium bovis. In south-west England, badgers Meles meles sustain endemic M. bovis infection and almost certainly transmit the disease to cattle. When tuberculosis outbreaks have occurred in cattle, the Ministry of agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) has therefore culled badgers to try to avert further outbreaks. 2. To limit the number of badgers killed, MAFF assessed a possible new strategy (the 'live test strategy') that used a serological test to identify and remove infected badgers. However, because the test correctly identified only 41% of truly infected badgers, individuals were pooled according to the setts at which they were sampled. All badgers were culled at setts where one or more seropositive animals were caught. 3. On average, 1.9 +/- 1.4 (SD) badgers were sampled at each sett. Using a simple model, we show that this level of sampling still gives a low (24-37%) probability of detecting infection at a given sett. 4. Badger social groups typically occupy more than one sett. We allocated setts to social groups by using Dirichlet tessellations and field signs to predict territory borders. On average, 3.3 +/- 2.8 badgers were sampled in each group, Our model shows that this increase in sample size gives probabilities of detecting M. bovis in truly infected groups of 43-62%, which is still likely to be unacceptably low, 5. Culling badgers according to the setts where they were trapped led to incomplete removal of social groups; some seronegative badgers were released in 61% of groups containing seropositive animals. as infection is clustered within groups, it is likely that some infected animals were released even though they tested seronegative. Incomplete removal might also cause social disruption that could accelerate the transmission of M. bovis between social groups. 6. We conclude that the live test strategy, as implemented, would be unlikely to reduce the overall prevalence of M. bovis infection in badgers, and thus the risk to cattle. Furthermore, the poor sensitivity of the serological test makes it unlikely that modifications to the live test protocol could increase its cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {Culling is often considered as a tool for controlling wildlife diseases that can also infect people or livestock. Culling European badgers Meles meles can cause both positive and negative effects on the incidence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle. One factor likely to influence the outcome of different badger-culling strategies for cattle TB is the reduction in badger population density achieved. However, this reduction is difficult to measure because badgers, being nocturnal and fossorial, are difficult to count. Here, we use indices of badger abundance to measure the population impacts of two culling strategies tested in Britain. The densities of badger setts and latrines recorded before culling were correlated with the densities of badgers captured on initial culls, suggesting that both were indices of actual badger abundance. Widespread 'proactive' culling was associated with a 73% reduction in the density of badger latrines, a 69% reduction in the density of active burrows and a 73% reduction in the density of road-killed badgers. This population reduction was achieved by a coordinated effort entailing widespread and repeated trapping over several years. However, this strategy caused only modest reductions in cattle TB incidence in culled areas and elevated incidence in neighbouring unculled areas. Localized 'reactive' culling caused a 26% reduction in latrine density, a 32% reduction in active burrow density and a 10% reduction in the density of road-killed badgers, but apparently increased the incidence of cattle TB. These results indicate that the relationship between badger population reduction and TB transmission to cattle is strongly non-linear, probably because culling prompts changes in badger behaviour that influence transmission rates. These findings raise serious questions about the capacity of badger culling to contribute to the control of cattle TB in Britain.},

Published information on the activity rhythm of the mole (Talpa europaea ), although limited to observations on a very few moles during February‐April, had indicated a basic short‐term cycle of approximately 8 hours. The technique used, manual tracking of radioactively tagged individuals with portable monitors, was modified for the present study to record automatically the presence or absence of the tagged mole at its nest site. Data were obtained for all months of the year, with a total of 797 days of records from 14 male and 13 female animals. The most characteristic feature of the records, irrespective of the time of year and thus daylength, was the sharpness of the transition from inactivity to activity at dawn and the reverse shortly prior to dusk. During midwinter, when daylength was short the animals tended to be active throughout the day, with few or no rest periods at the nest, and there was only one other active period, during the night. With increasing daylength there was usually a short rest period about midday so that the animals had the classical 3‐cycle daily rhythm. In summer, with the longest days and shortest nights the timing of the daytime rest period was variable and there was often no active period during the night so that the short‐term cycles were less distinct.},

Understanding the genetic connectivity and population structure of such elusive mammals is important for assessing their conservation status. In this study, we report the genetic diversity and structure of M. bechsteinii across Britain and Europe. Assessments were made using 14 microsatellite markers and a 747 bp region of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Nuclear DNA (microsatellites) showed high levels of genetic diversity and little inbreeding across the species range, though genetic diversity was slightly lower in Britain than in mainland Europe. Bayesian and spatial PCA analysis showed a clear separation between the British and European sites. Within Europe, the Italian population south of the Alps was isolated from the other sites. In Britain, there was genetic structuring between the northern and southern part of the geographical range. Despite there being little genetic divergence in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences throughout most of Europe, the mtDNA patterns in Britain confirmed this separation of northern and southern populations. Such genetic structuring within Britain-in the absence of any obvious physical barriers-suggests that other factors such as land-use may limit gene-flow.},

Spatially lagged autoregressive models were used to investigate the relationship between population abundance and measured habitat variables. Resident mink were found in places characterized by rich tree cover, plenty of scrub, rank grasses, and especially abundant rabbits, and they avoided open habitat characterized by farming activities. These trends were not detected, however, in either transient adults or juveniles. The presence of the opposite sex did not appear to influence the presence of resident mink of the other sex. The single most important feature influencing the presence of resident mink was the size of rabbit warrens. Warrens were, overall, the most important den sites for mink, especially for breeding females. Because the distribution of rabbit warrens seemed to be strongly affected by riverside farmland management, this might eventually determine the distribution and local population growth of feral mink in the Upper Thames region.},

abstract = {Indirect survey methods are often used in studies of mammals but are susceptible to biases caused by failure to detect species where they are present. Occupancy analysis is an analytical technique which enables non-detection rates to be estimated and which can be used to develop and refine novel survey methods. In this study, we investigated the use of footprint tunnels by volunteers as a method for surveying occupancy of sites by hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus. The survey protocol led to a very low non-detection rate and could reasonably be used to detect occupancy changes of 25% with statistical power of 0.95 in a national survey.},

abstract = {The rehabilitation of sick or injured wildlife and their subsequent release back into the wild is considered important, not only for the welfare of the individual animal but also for the conservation and management of endangered and threatened wildlife. The European hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus has declined by 25% in Britain over the last decade and is the most common mammal admitted to wildlife rehabilitation centres in Britain, with a large proportion of individuals admitted to gain body weight overwinter prior to release in the spring. Consequently, many thousands of hedgehogs are housed overwinter which incurs significant costs for rehabilitation centres, and has potentially animal welfare issues, such as, stress in captivity, reintroduction stress, increased mortality risk and impaired or altered behaviour. To determine if releasing rehabilitated hedgehogs during autumn and winter had an effect on their survival, body weight or nesting behaviour, we compared these factors between 34 rehabilitated hedgehogs with 23 wild hedgehogs across five sites in England over four different winters. Overwinter survival was high for both wild and rehabilitated hedgehogs, with a significant decrease in survival across both groups when hedgehogs became active post hibernation in spring. We found no differences in the survival rates up to 150days post release, in weight change, or nest use between wild- and winter-released rehabilitated hedgehogs. Our results suggest that under the correct conditions, rehabilitated hedgehogs can be released successfully during winter, therefore avoiding or reducing time in captivity.},

journal = {Journal of Zoology},
volume = {269},
number = {3},
pages = {349-356},
abstract = {Badgers Meles meles are intraguild predators of hedgehogs Erinaceus europaeus and have been shown to have a major effect on their abundance and behaviour at a localized scale. Previous studies have predicted the exclusion of hedgehogs from rural habitats in areas where badgers are abundant. The two species coexist at the landscape scale, however, as hedgehogs use suburban habitats, which are thought to provide a refuge from the effects of badger predation. We carried out surveys of hedgehog abundance and studied the use of spatial refugia by hedgehogs in relation to badger density and distribution in 10 study sites in the Midlands and south-west regions of England. Surveys confirmed that hedgehogs were almost absent from pasture fields in rural habitats, with their distribution concentrated in amenity grassland fields in suburban areas. However, although suburban habitats are less frequently used by badgers than rural areas, and therefore represented spatial refugia for hedgehogs, the probability of occurrence and abundance of hedgehogs varied in relation to the density of badger setts in the surrounding area. As sett density increased, both the probability of occurrence of hedgehogs and their abundance decreased. A generalized linear model predicted that the probability of hedgehog occurrence in suburban habitats declined towards zero in areas of high badger density. The most probable explanation is the negative effect of high badger abundance on the ability of hedgehogs to move between patches of suburban habitat. The present study concords with results from previous surveys and experimental studies, which found a strong negative spatial relationship between hedgehogs and badgers. It also provides correlative evidence that intraguild predation can exclude intraguild prey from productive habitats.},

abstract = {We monitored a barbastelle (Barbastella barbastellus) maternity roost for four months using a portable CCTV system, time synchronised with ultrasound recorders. We discovered three patterns of vocal activity not previously described. When barbastelles investigated the roost entrance, calls resembling the approach phase of echolocation were produced consisting of a group of 10 or more broadband pulses of low amplitude, not detected more than a few metres from the roost. The other two distinct vocal patterns were produced during swarming around the roost tree. The first consisted of broadband pulses which were similar to those in the approach pattern, but which tended to be produced in a dynamic group rather than a fixed pattern. They were of higher amplitude than the approach echolocation pulses and were considered to be swarming echolocation pulses. This pattern frequently morphed into sequences containing social calls with a quasi-constant frequency (QCF) tail of very high amplitude. These social calls were likely produced to warn approaching bats on a potential collision course, similar to calls previously described in other species as 'honking'. In addition to these three vocalisations, standard echolocation pulses were emitted, as well as hooked calls presumably having a social context. These latter two vocalisations were less commonly recorded in our study. Pulse duration was shortest for approach echolocation and longest for the hooked social calls. Amplitude was lowest for approach echolocation and highest for swarming honking calls. The QCF tail in swarming honking was steeper than for swarming social calls. CCTV video evidence (by motion detection) proved invaluable for relating behaviour to call type.},

abstract = {We studied foraging behavior and habitat selection of barbastelle bats (Barhastella barhastellus) at two breeding colonies in southern England. In total, 28 adult female bats were radiotracked to determine home range use, habitat preferences, and patterns of nocturnal activity. Individual home ranges varied considerably, with bats traveling between 1 and 20 km to reach foraging areas ((X) over bar = 6.8 km +/- 4.8 SD). Nonreproductive females foraged at greater distances than reproductive females, providing evidence of state-dependent foraging behavior. Commutes were typically rapid and direct and bats moved freely across large open areas. Individual bats foraged independently from one another and were highly faithful to their respective core foraging areas, which formed just a small fraction of home ranges. Riparian zones and broad-leaved woodland were habitats most strongly selected for foraging. Unimproved grassland and field margins were also important components of the foraging environment. Bats night-roosted only occasionally and for short periods. Conservation efforts for B. barbastellus should target the protection and enhancement of preferred foraging habitats within 7 km of roost sites. Linear landscape elements such as tree lines and hedgerows should be managed to improve their value to foraging bats and to enhance connectivity with roost sites.},

abstract = {The rapid global spread of artificial light at night is causing unprecedented disruption to ecosystems. In otherwise dark environments, street lights restrict the use of major flight routes by some bats, including the threatened lesser horseshoe bat Rhinolophus hipposideros, and may disrupt foraging. Using radio tracking, we examined the response of individual female R. hipposideros to experimental street lights placed on hedgerows used as major flight routes. Hedgerows were illuminated on one side over four nights using lights with different emission spectra, while the opposite side of the hedge was not illuminated. Automated bat detectors were used to examine changes in overall bat activity by R. hipposideros and other bat species present. R. hipposideros activity reduced significantly under all light types, including red light, challenging a previously held assumption that red light is safe for bats. Despite this, R. hipposideros rapidly adapted to the presence of lights by switching their flight paths to the dark side of the hedgerow, enabling them to reach foraging sites without restriction. Red light had no effect on the activity of the other species present. Slow-flying Myotis spp. avoided orange, white and green light, while more agile Pipistrellus spp. were significantly more active at these light types compared to dark controls, most probably in response to accumulations of insect prey. No effect of any light type was found for Nyctalus or Eptesicus spp. Our findings demonstrate that caution must be used when promoting forms of lighting that are thought to be safe for wildlife before they are tested more widely. We argue that it is essential to preserve dark corridors to mitigate the impacts of artificial light at night on bat activity and movements.},

abstract = {The aim of the study reported in this paper was to investigate the dispersal of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) between small woodlands in an agricultural landscape. By using live trapping and capture-mark-recapture methods, 1017 wood mice and bank voles were trapped and 78 movements between habitats were monitored. The results demonstrate that hedgerows are important both for settlement and for corridors for dispersing small mammals. The study also tends to indicate that increasing distance and lack of hedgerows reduces the number of wood mice moving between woodlands, and that the degree of isolation may vary in time depending on the nature of the ground cover provided by the arable crop.},

journal = {Journal of Animal Ecology},
volume = {80},
number = {1},
pages = {259-269},
abstract = {P>1. The absolute energy needs of small animals are generally lower than those of larger animals. This should drive higher mortality of larger animals, when the environmental conditions deteriorate. However, demonstration of the effect of energy constraints on survivals proved difficult, because the range of body mass within species is generally too small to produce enough variation for studying such an effect. An opportunity for an intraspecific study comes from weasels inhabiting the Bialowieza Forest (north-eastern Poland), which are characterized by a threefold variation in body mass. 2. We assumed that in summer larger weasel males are favoured by sexual selection, because they are more successful when competing for mates. We then tested whether they suffer higher mortality in winter, because they have difficulty finding sufficient food to satisfy their energy needs and/or because the additional foraging time would result in increased exposure to predation. 3. We measured daily energy expenditures (DEE) of overwintering weasel males using the doubly labelled water (DLW) technique. We constructed an energetic model predicting how individuals of different size are able to balance their energy budgets feeding on large and small prey while minimizing time spent hunting, thereby reducing their own exposure to predation. 4. The range of body mass in overwintering weasels predicted by our model corresponded very well with the distribution of prey body mass in three different habitats within our study area. Larger individuals were able to compensate for higher food requirements by using habitats with larger prey species than those available to smaller male weasels. This effectively offset the expected negative association between body mass and winter survival predicted from considerations of energy balance. 5. Our results show how energetic constraints affect body mass and spatial segregation of a species at the intra-specific level not only across large geographical ranges, but also within a relatively small area.},
